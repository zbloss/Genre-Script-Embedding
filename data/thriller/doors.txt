EXT. AMAZONIA - SUNSET 

Subtitle: Amazonia 1960. 

A Ceremonial House in the upper reaches of the Amazon basin, 
"ceremonial house" being a euphemism for a raised platform 
covered by a thatched roof. In the distance, the sun slants 
low over an unending expanse of verdant jungle. 

A half dozen HIPPIE EXPATS sit around a low rough hewn table. 
Atop the table of Heaven an earthen bowl, decorated with 
multi-colored scenes and fantastic creatures, is circled by 
drinking cups. 

ETHAN RANKIN, 20, and VINCE GARWOOD, 19, the two American 
expats, wear jeans, sandals, T-shirts and long hair. Their 
skin has a dull bluish color, the result of residue of a 
purification bath. Trance music, constant, evolving, ripples 
below the surface. 

The expats look one to the other as the SHAMAN, an elderly 
mestivo, ladles a brownish brew from the bowl into the 
individual cups. His assistant, DON MACITA, 36, helps him. 

Ethan and Vince's expressions fluctuate from nervous to 
expectant. 

Each cradles his cup in his hands as the Shaman, dispensing 
the "tea," starts to sing an ancient icaros, a ritual chant, 
the melody which will accompany them on their journey. 

On a pre-arranged signal, each of the ceremonialists drinks 
the brew in one sustained swallow. 

TIMECUT. NIGHT: the hippie expats are scattered to the far 
reaches of the Ceremonial House, each barfing and shitting 
(off camera, hopefully) their insides out. 

Vince, wobbly, crawls to where Ethan lies: 

VINCE 
Ethan... 
(no answer) 
Rankin? 

ETHAN 
Vince? 

VINCE 
How are you? 

ETHAN 
You? 

VINCE 
Weak, spacey. 

Ethan's countenance changes: his face becomes placid, his 
eyes widen. 

VINCE 
Ethan? 

ETHAN 
Oh, Jesus, oh my God... 

INSIDE ETHAN'S MIND'S EYE: he shoots at sling-shot speed 
across the jungle canopy, trailing stars and clouds to his 
right and left; then, rapidly approaching from the horizon, 
a giant iridescent speckled SERPENT zooms into view, its 
jaws open. 

Inside we fly, whirling through the serpent like passengers 
on an animistic roller coaster, until, twisting and turning, 
the light grows bright and bursts into a kaleidoscope of 
color --

INT. RAVE CLUB - NIGHT 

The rainbow of colored light comes from dozens of flashing 
bulbs reflecting off a disco ball. Trance music cross- 
dissolves into techno with a Latin beat. 

Below, a throbbing mass of kids gyrate and thrash. 

Amid the mass of sweating ecstatic Mexicanos, RUSSELL RANKIN, 
26, hops from one partner to the next. Russ' unkempt hair 
and club clothes can't disguise what he is: American, 
intellectual, middle class -- a student on permanent foreign 
leave. 

The music grows discordant, off. Russell looks around: 
something seems wrong. 

He stops dancing, stares, anxious. 

Definitely wrong. 

He's growing paranoid. Is it the drugs? No, is it the music, 
an earthquake? No. 

He pushes his way toward the "Salida." A FRIEND, noticing 
the expression of Russ' face, calls to him: 

FRIEND 
Russ, where you going? 

RUSSELL 
I've got to go! Something's wrong! 

FRIEND 
Where? 

RUSSELL 
I don't know. 

FRIEND 
Chill, come on, we'll go someplace. 

RUSSELL 
No, I've got to go home. 

FRIEND 
Home? 

Russ elbows his way outside. 

CUT TO: 

INT. MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 

Russ, in a panic, throws clothes into a duffel bag in his 
hostel like residence. 

The walls are decorated with third world agit-prop, 
psychedelic posters and Pre-Raphaelite prints. 

CUT TO: 

INT. MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - NIGHT 

Just a few stranded travelers; otherwise, empty rows of 
geometric chairs. Russ leans over the counter of the only 
airline still open: 

RUSSELL 
I need to get to Portland, Oregon, 
US, on the next flight possible, the 
next connection. 

CLERK 
There wouldn't be anything until 
morning. Six o'clock. 

RUSSELL 
Put me on it. I have cash. 

Russell pulls all the money he has out of his pocket. 

CLERK 
(suspicious) 
Do you have a passport? 

RUSSELL 
(pulls it out) 
Right here. 
(explaining) 
Family emergency.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

Subtitle: Portland. 

An institutionally plain classroom. HUME (HUGH) RANKIN, 30, 
stands before a mixed audience: male, female, older, younger, 
mostly white. 

Rankin, angular, clean cut, wears a white shirt with a silk 
tie. If he and his brother Russell could be put in boxes, he 
would be "straight," and Russ would be "hip," although, in 
fact, neither can be so simply defined. 

In the back sits Vince Garwood, now 60, wearing professorial 
jacket and tie. 

It's not a class per se, as indicated by the fact that some 
listeners drink coffee, some are dressed in soiled work 
clothes, others business outfits. Hume speaks: 

HUME 
...I've been through this with each 
of you individually, but now, 
collectively, we have the joint 
opportunity to air any concerns or 
anxieties. This DMT -- 
dimethyltryptamine -- trial is the 
first such study to be approved by 
the FDA, so forgive us if we err on 
the side of caution. We have chosen 
DMT as the pioneer psychotropic 
compound for several reasons: it 
naturally occurs in the body, evident 
in such states as schizophrenia and 
manic depression. To the extent that 
we can understand why Serotonin is 
affected by DMT, we might unlock 
some of the mysteries for such 
disabling disorders. Second, it is 
an intense drug. The visions will be 
strong. Third, it's short acting. 
It's in and out fast. Should anyone 
have an unpleasant experience, at 
least it will be over quickly. All 
of you have previous experiences 
with psychedelic drugs, some extensive 
experience. This will be a much more 
controlled environment. 1.0 mg/kg of 
dimethyltryptamine will be injected 
intramuscularly, not smoked as is 
the usual practice. This retards the 
speed at which the drug becomes 
effective, but it's the only way to 
be sure everyone receives the same 
dosage. You've all signed the informed 
consent forms, but I wanted to take 
this opportunity to invite your 
friends and relatives to an open 
forum. If anyone has any questions, 
please ask. If anyone has second 
thoughts about being a trial subject, 
you may withdraw your consent at any 
time. Questions? 

An awkward seat-shifting. No one wants to appear unhip. The 
GIRLFRIEND of one of the trial participants half-raises her 
hand. 

HUME 
Yes? 

GIRLFRIEND 
Dr. Rankin... 

HUME 
Hugh. 

GIRLFRIEND 
Have you taken 
dimetheltrimethitripo... 
(awkward communal 
laugh) 
...DMT? 

HUME 
Since 1970 dimethyltryptamine, along 
with virtually every other 
hallucinogen, has been a Schedule I 
drug, meaning that any unauthorized 
use is a crime. I do not break the 
law. But yes, I have taken DMT, 
inhaled and intramuscular, outside 
the country and in legally approved 
situations. Is it dangerous? Only if 
you fear death by astonishment. 
(scattered laughter) 
Because you will be astonished. I 
have zero qualms about administering 
or using this substance. 

An OLDER MAN raises his hand: 

OLDER MAN 
There are those, and I'm not one of 
them, who say this program is just 
an excuse for recreational drug use. 

Nervous laughter. The audience is predominantly and 
unabashedly pro-drug. 

HUME 
I don't like the word "recreational." 
It implies something trivial. Vision- 
inducing plants are functional, and 
have been for hundreds, maybe 
thousands of years. They teach us 
about ourselves. A DMT voyage, like 
any trip, is instructional. You will 
return knowing more about the world 
around you and the world inside you. 
(beat) 
The purpose of the trial is not 
recreational, it is scientific. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - DAY 

Hume and Vince Garwood walk along the hallway leading from 
the classroom. Participants small talk in the background. 

HUME 
What do you think? 

VINCE 
You mean were there any "spies," 
members of Fifth Estate? No, it was 
cool. You did good. 

HUME 
Thanks, Vince. 

VINCE 
It's such a delicate balance. You 
want to be open and candid -- we 
have nothing to hide; on the other 
hand, we all know the devastating 
effects too much publicity have had 
on this type of research. 
(beat) 
I particularly liked the line about 
not breaking the law. 

Hume chuckles as Garwood stops at his office, opens the door. 
Inside it's a rat's nest of books, papers and ethographic 
souvenirs. Framed pictures of Emmanuel Swedenborg, William 
Blake and Aldous Huxley hang between the windows. 

VINCE 
When do you start? 

HUME 
Monday. You going to be there for 
the first trials? 

VINCE 
What time? 

HUME 
Ten a.m. At the clinic. 

VINCE 
Okay. Again, good work. 

They nod goodbye as Garwood closes the door. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 

Hume drives his green Camry through the leafy South Park 
streets surrounding the university. 

He slows, turns into the driveway of his 20's "California 
cottage" house. Portland, the Martha Stewart of American 
cities, enforces zoning regulations to preserve the quaint 
nature of its older neighborhoods. 

On the front steps sits Russell Rankin, unshaven, duffel bag 
at his side. 

It takes Hume, getting out of the car, a moment to recognize 
his brother: 

HUME 
Russ, is that you? Russell? 

Russ gets up, sheepishly slouches over to his brother who 
embraces him. 

HUME 
Jeez, six months without a boo or a 
bah, now -- it's great to see you. 
What's going on? 

RUSSELL 
I just felt... I wanted to come home. 

HUME 
Well, come in. Meet Allison... 
(looks around) 
I guess she's not home yet. Come on 
in. You want a beer or a soda or 
anything? 

Hugh pulls out his house keys as they walk up the steps. 

RUSSELL 
Water. I'm thirsty from the plane. 

CUT TO: 

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 

Russ looks around the room: sofa, mismatched chairs, dining 
table stacked high with books -- furnishings familiar to 
anyone who has spent an extended period in grad school. A 
Haitian painting depicting a voodoo ceremony hangs in the 
dining room. 

One corner of the room has been sectioned off. A wooden Buddha 
in the Padmasana position sits on a covered pedestal, before 
it, a meditation mat and between the mat and Buddha, incense 
censors and joss sticks. 

Hume returns from the kitchen bearing a glass of water. Russ 
gulps the water, sighs. There's something on his mind. 

HUME 
Okay, brother, com'on, out with it. 
What happened? 

RUSSELL 
It's hard to explain. 

HUME 
Are you in trouble? 

RUSSELL 
No. I was in a club the other night, 
well, last night, in Mexico City, 
that's where I've been living, getting 
into Indian culture and all that and 
I got this feeling, this very strong 
feeling, that something was wrong. 
That someone was in danger -- 

HUME 
You had a panic attack. 

RUSSELL 
I had a premonition. 
(beat) 
Is Mom all right? 

HUME 
You should have called. 

RUSSELL 
I wanted to see her. Is she all right? 

HUME 
You all right? 

Russ nods. Hugh sighs, confirms his brother's fears: 

HUME 
There may be a reoccurrence of the 
cancer. In her lungs. 

Russell emits a noise; he knew it: 

RUSSELL 
Let's go see her. 

HUME 
I'll call. We'll drop by tomorrow. 

RUSSELL 
We could go now. 

HUME 
(firm) 
Tomorrow afternoon. I've got to have 
some time to prepare her. You two 
didn't exactly leave on the best of 
terms. 
(beat) 
You need some rest. And a shave. 

CUT TO: 

INT. MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 

Freshly cut flowers in a vase; the boys' gift to their mother. 

EVANGELINE RANKIN, 59, Russell and Hume's mother, cradles a 
cup of coffee. The decor is middle-brow, but not cheesy (tansu 
chest, prints by local artists, etc.). 

Evangeline, a bit gaunt, exhibits the healthy glow associated 
with the Northwest's outdoor culture. She wears a shiny gold 
cross. 

Hume and Russell, also holding cups of coffee, sit on the 
edges of their matching upholstered chairs. The mood is more 
formal than one would expect of a family "reunion." 

EVANGELINE 
More coffee? 

HUME 
No, Mom, I'm fine. 

RUSSELL 
Me too. 

EVANGELINE 
It's from Kona. 
(off their reactions) 
The coffee. 

RUSSELL 
Delicious. 

HUME 
Were you out this morning, power- 
walking? 

EVANGELINE 
Yes, with Judy, but these days it's 
more walk than power. In fact, we 
turned back after fifteen minutes. 

Awkward beat: no one wants to bring up her failing medical 
condition. 

EVANGELINE 
(to Russell) 
Are you planning to stay long? 

RUSSELL 
A couple of days at least. We'll see 
what happens. It's good to see you. 

Hume sets his coffee down, gets up: 

HUME 
I gotta go see a man about a dog. 

He heads for the bathroom. Evangeline and Russ smile; this 
is an old family expression. 

EVANGELINE 
(to Russ) 
You were in Mexico City? 
(he nods) 
The American University? 

RUSSELL 
Well, it isn't a school in the formal 
sense. It's a group of young scholars 
with sympathetic interests -- 

EVANGELINE 
Like a commune? 

RUSSELL 
We wouldn't use that term. 

EVANGELINE 
And these sympathetic interests, 
what are they? 

RUSSELL 
Indigenous American cultures. Pre- 
Columbian societies. Tribal 
organizations, tribal rites -- 

EVANGELINE 
You mean peyote. You're talking about 
peyote, right? 
(no reply) 
Oh my God. 

RUSSELL 
It's nothing to be ashamed of. What 
do you think Hume does at the 
University, at the clinic? 

Her reply is sharp, censorious -- and full of denial: 

EVANGELINE 
He's a bio-chemist. 

RUSSELL 
He does drug research. 

EVANGELINE 
He has a Ph.D. 

Russ rolls his eyes. Her tone turns angry: 

EVANGELINE 
Everything that has gone wrong with 
this family can be traced directly 
back to drugs. 

RUSSELL 
Mom, stop. Just stop. 

EVANGELINE 
Drugs have been the death of this 
family. 

Russ, already on tender hooks, reaches the end of his proper 
behavior: 

RUSSELL 
No wonder Dad left you. Jesus Christ. 
Tell me, has he ever been in touch 
with you in, what, twenty years? 

She starts to cry. Hume, returning, overhearing Russ' 
conversation, groans: he should have never left them alone. 
Evangeline turns to Hume: 

EVANGELINE 
He hasn't changed. He's always looking 
for trouble, he goes to jail -- 

HUME 
Mom, it was petty larceny -- 

EVANGELINE 
And drugs. 

HUME 
He was never in jail. He was on 
probation. 

EVANGELINE 
Every time I see him I see his father. 

Russ, fed up, stands up: 

RUSSELL 
That's it. 
(to mother) 
I don't blame him. 

Hume grabs his brother by the arm and, shooting his mother a 
hard look, escorts Russ to the front door. 

RUSSELL 
(to Hume) 
She lives in worst case scenario- 
land. 

HUME 
(looking back) 
Mom, I'll call you. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 

They emerge from the proper middle-class home. Hume, keeping 
Russell moving, heads toward the Camry. 

RUSSELL 
I don't know why I came back. What 
was I thinking? It was a bad idea. 

HUME 
(reproachful) 
Russ. 

BAM! They run smack into a thirtiesh GARDENER: 

RUSSELL 
Asshole! Why don't you look were the 
fuck you're going? 

Hume throws an apologetic look at the Gardener ("It's 
nothing"), continues toward the car. 

CUT TO: 

INT. HUME DINING ROOM - NIGHT 

Hume, Russ, and ALLISON sit around the empty dinner plates, 
sip tea, wine. Allison, 25, is the model of intelligent 
hipness: attractive, long-hair tied in a ponytail, wearing a 
loose plaid shirt. 

ALLISON 
...I was trying to teach my students 
about life. I said to them, "The 
only way you can be sure you are 
loved for yourself and not for money 
or sex, is if you are unattractive 
and poor." But then I explained it's 
very hard to be loved if you are 
like that. 

RUSSELL 
That makes love practically 
impossible. 

ALLISON 
They need to know what they're up 
against. 

They laugh. Allison turns to Russ: 

ALLISON 
Hume's talked about you a lot, and I 
have to say, I haven't been 
disappointed. 

RUSSELL 
(chuckles) 
Yeah, I really fucked up today. 

ALLISON 
You should go back, not tomorrow, 
but soon, and apologize. 

RUSSELL 
(hard, edgy) 
That's one point of view. 

ALLISON 
Yes. Mine. 

Allison shakes a cigarette from a pack, lights up. Russ looks 
to Hume; she explains: 

ALLISON 
Hume doesn't approve of artificially 
enhanced nicotine. 

HUME 
One makes certain concessions for 
love. 

ALLISON 
(to Russ) 
You want one? 

RUSSELL 
Nah. But you know, of course, 
marijuana is also carcinogenic. 

HUME 
Well... 

Allison starts to stack the plates. 

HUME 
Here, let us help you. 

Russ reaches over to assist his brother. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 

Hume and Russell sit on the front steps sipping Chardonnay. 
Night crickets are interrupted by the sound of the occasional 
passing car. 

RUSSELL 
To be honest, I'd sort of come to 
the end of my interest in mescaline. 
Mostly just getting stoned. 

HUME 
That's what you were doing in that 
club? When you had the panic attack? 

RUSSELL 
(sheepish) 
Not really. 

HUME 
MDMA. 

RUSSELL 
Yep. 

HUME 
It's an interesting drug. There's 
important work being done on Ecstacy 
at John Hopkins, in Barcelona: 
neuroendocrine effects, vasopressin 
secretion... 

RUSSELL 
What are you into? 

HUME 
We're starting a trial on DMT. 

RUSSELL 
The harmalines? Hoo boy. The heavy 
stuff. How you get away with that? 

HUME 
Cause I'm a good boy. 

RUSSELL 
How can you put up with it? All the 
shit you have to deal with in this 
country? 

HUME 
Somebody's got to stay and fight the 
good fight. The best labs are here, 
the best scientists are here -- you 
do work in this country and the 
scientific community has to take it 
seriously. Besides, with the internet, 
everybody is connected now. You know 
the organization MAPS? 
(Russ nods) 
Through MAPS now we're in constant 
contact with research all around the 
world: Spain, Finland, Brazil. It's 
not like it used to be. 

RUSSELL 
Good old Hume Rankin. 

HUME 
Don't mock me bro. 

RUSSELL 
(lifts glass) 
Excuse-moi. 

HUME 
(click glasses) 
Things are going to change. It's too 
important not to change. 

RUSSELL 
Psilocybin, that's where I realized 
I wanted to be, but I just wasn't... 
well, I just I was scared. The big 
drugs, the See God drugs, that's 
what it's all about. 

HUME 
This extraordinary imagery we all 
have within us. These things, 
unworldly things, that just appear. 
Where do they come from? What are 
they trying to say? 

RUSSELL 
The old dilemma. You open those doors 
of perception, what happens? Do you 
see this world more clearly or do 
you come in contact with another 
world? 

HUME 
Does the inside come out or does the 
Outside come in? 

RUSSELL 
The Freud/Jung dilemma. 

HUME 
It's not politically correct, and 
I'll deny I've said this if you repeat 
it, but I believe there's a parallel 
world of awareness that these plants 
give us access to. It may be the way 
primitive man first became aware of 
the spiritual world. 

RUSSELL 
(joking) 
"Jesus was a plant." 

HUME 
(responding in kind) 
I deny it. I never said that. 

RUSSELL 
So, this DMT trial, you got everyone 
signed up? 
(Hume nods) 
You can't fit one more in? 

HUME 
Why? 

RUSSELL 
You got a bunch of Portland Deadheads 
signed up for this trial and you're 
going to interview them silly. 
Wouldn't it be better to have one 
subject who has studied psychotropic 
affect, who's personal history is 
intimately conjoined with your own, 
someone with whom you can truly 
discuss the results of the trip? 

HUME 
You want in? 

RUSSELL 
Can you swing it? 

HUME 
(thinks) 
Yeah. If you don't advertise. 

RUSSELL 
Yes sir. 
(beat) 
Tell me one thing, Professor Rankin. 

HUME 
What? 

RUSSELL 
Do you, ah, offer Mileage Plus?

INT. HAMBURGER KING - DAY 

Russell fills out a form under the MANAGER'S watchful eye. 
The Manager can't help but notice Russ' overqualifications.

Not really, I'm between situations. 
I need short term employment. I don't 
want to be a burden on my friends. 

MANAGER 
We have an investment in training 
you. 

RUSSELL

It's a counter position.

INT. HEAD SHOP - DAY 

Russ steps over to the counter, approaches an eighteen year- 
old head in a KORN T-SHIRT. 

RUSSELL 
Chuck around? 

KORN SHIRT 
Chuck who? 

RUSSELL 
Wistelm. "Chuckie Wisdom." 

KORN SHIRT 
Oh yeah, Chuckie. No, nah, I don't 
know. 

RUSSELL 
I used to hang here. 

KORN SHIRT 
He got busted -- or maybe not, I'm 
not sure. That was before my time. 

RUSSELL 
How long you been here? 

KORN SHIRT 
Six weeks. 
(recognizing him) 
You're Russ Rankin, right? 
(Russ shrugs) 
I'm Joe. I came here, like before I 
had this, like job -- you're heavy, 
you were like a major dope dude huh? 
(calls to unseen 
employee) 
Hey, this is Russ Rankin. 

Russ changes his mind about coming here: 

RUSSELL 
My name's Bob. 

A TEENAGE FEMALE EMPLOYEE, tattooed, huge breasted under a 
Marley shirt, walks over. 

FEMALE EMPLOYEE 
Yeah? 

RUSSELL 
I was just looking for Chuckie Wisdom. 

FEMALE EMPLOYEE 
Chuckie who? 

RUSSELL 
Hey, it's nothing. Groove on. 

He walks off. 

FEMALE EMPLOYEE 
You find him, tell him I got some 
crabs of his. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CLINIC - DAY 

Russell, with three other trial participants, walks down a 
severe hospital corridor with Hume and two ASSISTANTS. 

Russ, looking at the patient rooms, the white walls, the 
brutal machinery of modern medicine, turns to Hume: 

RUSSELL 
And they wonder why people have bad 
trips? 

HUME 
The setting isn't what it should be, 
but it's important to operate in a 
clinical environment. Anyway, the 
"set," the mind set, is more important 
than the physical setting. 

RUSSELL 
No problem. 

CUT TO: 

INT. TRIAL CLINICAL LAB - DAY 

Russ and the other volunteers sit in leisure chairs in a 
white-walled room. Each, sleeves rolled up, has a blood 
pressure cuff and IV attached to one arm, a double-valve 
blood needle to the other. EKG wires extend from under their 
smocks. 

The Assistant draws blood from each of the participants as 
Hume, wearing a blue button down collar shirt with a dark 
tie, lowers the lights on a rheostat. 

HUME 
We will, during the duration of the 
trial, approximately twenty minutes, 
draw blood at regular intervals as 
well as check pupil diameters -- 
none of which will effect your 
experience. If anything, it will 
provide a comforting connection to 
the real world of the clinic. Are 
there any questions? 

No questions. The volunteers are prepared, even eager. Hume 
steps back to five video cameras, one trained on each of the 
participants, checks if they are running: all red lights 
glow. 

Hume steps away, looks as the door opens: Garwood enters the 
darkened room. 

HUME 
Relax your muscles, let the tension 
flow from your bodies and: pay 
attention. 

Hume gives the signal: the Assistants move from one 
participant to the next, opening the IV valves, letting the 
saline/DMT mix flow into the tubes. The Assistants withdraw, 
pick up their clipboards, sit on folding chairs, one against 
each wall. 

EKG machines: heart rates slow. 

Trance music, first a faint echo, grows louder; the drug 
starts to take effect: Russell's eyes slowly close as the 
camera goes through the eyelid, into his mydriatic (dilated) 
eyeball. 

Author's Note: There are several extended trip sequences in 
the script. Although I will sketch the rudimentary stages of 
each trip, words are inadequate to describe a multi-layered 
constantly morphing hallucinogenic experience. Although the 
trip descriptions necessarily fall into linear, logical 
patterns, the final screen images should be much more free- 
flowing and imagistic. A better reference would be by the 
computer graphic "trip" videos put out by Sony Music Video 
(with titles like "Odyssey Into the Mind's Eye," "Luminous 
Visions" and "Ancient Alien"). The effects that can be created 
by cutting edge computer graphics are, as the saying goes, 
"mind blowing." 

IN RUSS' MIND'S EYE: the geometric lines of the room collide, 
fall away as we tumble, into the vortex, through the twisting 
tube to the other side. 

RUSSELL'S VOICE 
It's falling away... 

The sound of crinkling cellphone, a rising tone, then, 
suddenly, out of the tunnel the world explodes in splintering 
mandalas of pink, red, and orange. It is as Mircea Eliade 
wrote about the religious experience, "a complete rupture of 
the mundane plain." 

The kaleidoscope of splintered colors trails like a fleeting 
firebird giving way to an undulating SEA OF SERENITY. 

Off to the left, in the distance, lies the Ice Country, but 
we're not going there. A flock of strangely colored birds 
glide below, their trills merging with the music like a choir. 

We pass the waterfall where dead souls bathe. 

The effect is not unlike that of a child observing a three- 
ring circus: so much is happening, so much that we've never 
seen before, all of it simultaneous -- and all of it so 
astonishing. There's no way to absorb it all. One only watches 
with slack-jawed wonder. 

IN THE CLINIC: Hume watches as an Assistant takes Russ' blood 
pressure. Russell sits unmoving, lost in time and space. 

IN HIS MIND'S EYE: a HIGH PLAIN appears in the distance; 
approaching, it's green and welcoming. On the horizon, an 
eerie light glows. 

Small creatures scramble across the plain as we land. As 
they approach we realize these are the ELVES, miniature 
mutating folk radiating joy and playfulness. They're all 
smiling. 

The grass grows tall, soon we're in an ancient overgrown 
FORREST. The elves lead us through the darkening wood. 

A panther watches from a tree limb, his eyes piercing trees. 
The music darkens, an ominous mood wells from the Earth's 
core. 

But the elves still seem happy and we follow, moving quicker 
now. 

Out of the forest, on the valley floor, sits the SAUCER, the 
source of the eerie glow. The silver skin pulsates like a 
living being. This is where the elves have been leading us -- 
but now, suddenly they're gone. 

The door to the saucer opens; a blue warmth radiates from 
within. A human silhouette appears in the doorway. We draw 
nearer. 

The silhouette is Evangeline, her arms across her stomach. 
She pulls back her hands, revealing an open wound. Her hands 
are red with blood. 

IN THE CLINIC: Russ shifts in his chair anxiously. It's as 
if he's trying to get out of his body without standing up. 

Hume checks the EKG monitor; Russ' heart rate increases. 

RUSSELL 
Mom. 

IN HIS MIND'S EYE: Evangeline extends her hand, leads us 
inside. The music, still hypnotic, has taken on a frightening 
Nine Inch Nails quality. 

Inside the saucer we're led from room to room. Shifting planes 
of shades of blue surround us. The floors seem liquid at our 
feet. He hears a TV show, "Jeopardy." Alex Trebek says "The 
Taj Mahal, Solomon's Palace and Billy Joel's beach house all 
have this in common." 

Evangeline takes us to where a thirty year-old man stands 
wearing dark old jeans and a T-shirt. Hanging from one hand 
is a blood dripping butcher knife. This is the MURDERER. 

IN THE CLINIC: Russ squirms. Hume checks his watch; it's 
been eighteen minutes. One of the other participants opens 
his eyes, says something to one of the Assistants. 

RUSSELL 
Stop, stop. 

IN RUSS' MIND'S EYE: The murderer lifts his other hand. From 
his fingers tangles Evangeline's gold cross. He presses the 
cross into our palm. 

We fall into the WHIRLPOOL. 

IN THE CLINIC: Russell awakens, frightened, trembling, his 
face beaded with sweat. Hume kneels beside him. Russ attempts 
to speak, but cannot. 

HUME 
Russ? 

He looks at the EKG monitor, double-checks with the Assistant 
who is taking Russ' pulse, checking his pupil dilation. She 
indicates Russ is fine. 

RUSSELL 
(groggy) 
We have to go to mother's house. 

HUME 
We can't do that. You're not fully 
down yet. We'll go in a while. 

RUSSELL 
(soft, urgent) 
No, we've got to go now. 

Hume attempts to calm him, but now Russ is on his feet, 
pulling the EKG sensors from his chest, blood pressure cuff 
from his arm. He starts for the exit. 

RUSSELL 
I'll go on my own. 

Russ breaks free from the Assistant's attempt to restrain 
him, heads for the exit. Hume calls after: 

HUME 
No, no, I'll take you. Let's get 
your shirt. 

Hume throws a perplexed backward glance to Garwood as he 
follows. 

CUT TO: 

INT./EXT. HUME'S CAR - DAY 

Russ, wearing his street shirt, rides shotgun as Hume 
negotiates the Camry though a Portland suburban subdivision. 
Russ' eyes are focused on the road ahead. Classic rock plays 
on the FM. 

RUSSELL 
Turn it off. 

It takes Hume a moment to understand what his brother means. 
He clicks off the stereo. 

HUME 
What happened? What's this all about? 
(no reply) 
You're just going to sit there? I 
mean, what can be so bad? You're not 
going to create a scene are you? 

They turn a corner: the house appears. Russ tenses. 

Hume pulls into the drive, parks behind their mother's van. 
They get out, walk to the front door. 

At the door: Hume rings the chimes. No answer. Rings again. 
The brothers look to each other. Hume turns the knob: it's 
unlocked. 

The door swings open. They step inside -- 

CUT TO: 

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 

Everything appears normal, everything as it was the day 
before. Russ and Hume walk into the living room. 

Day old cut flowers in their vase. 

Russell relaxes. Maybe it's nothing after all. Then, from 
the TV room, he HEARS A SOUND which sends a chill up his 
spine: "Jeopardy." 

Alex Trebek's voice echoes from the den: "The Taj Mahal, 
Solomon's Palace and Billy Joel's beach house have this in 
common." Buzzer sound. "Yes, Mike." Russ turns his head, 
catching TV Mike as he replies: "They were all built for 
love." 

Russ, now fearful, notices red stains on the carpet as they 
proceed. The bedroom door is ajar. It hits Hume: something 
is very wrong: 

HUME 
Mom? 

Russell pushes the bedroom door open, revealing a horrific 
tableau. 

Evangeline, her stomach sliced open, her hands cut with 
defensive wounds, her breast repeatedly punctured, lies beside 
the bed. Everywhere, the room shows signs of a struggle: a 
lamp knocked over, chair askew, coverlet half off the 
mattress. 

Hume resists the impulse to rush to his mother's side. Russ, 
his head in his hands, sobs. 

HUME 
(quiet) 
Don't touch anything. It's a crime 
scene. Mother, Mom, Mom... 

Hume steps closer. 

RUSSELL 
She's dead. 

HUME 
(voice cracks) 
Yes. 
(beat) 
I'm going to another room, call 911. 
Are you all right? I mean, to deal 
with the police and whatever. I could 
drive you home, come back and call. 

RUSSELL 
No, I'm all right. I'm down. Go ahead 
and call. 
(beat) 
Hume? 

HUME 
Yeah? 
(no reply) 
Russell? 

RUSSELL 
I saw it. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 

Paramedics wheel the gurney carrying Evangeline's body bag 
to an awaiting EMS vehicle. Police cars are parked at every 
which angle. Crime scene tape fences off the front yard as 
officers hold back curious onlookers and media crew. 

CUT TO: 

INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 

Hume and Russ sit on the chairs they occupied the day before. 
Across from them is Homicide Detective LAWRENCE, 40, a veteran 
of such situations. 

Police and M.E. technicians go through the house with orderly 
precision, collecting evidence. Glancing time to time at the 
victim's sons, the technicians work as silently as possible. 

LAWRENCE 
...I'll be in touch tomorrow, Dr. 
Rankin, but you touched nothing? 

HUME 
The front door, we walked here, here, 
there -- otherwise, nothing. I used 
the phone in the den. 

RUSSELL 
We were here yesterday. That's why 
we came back. We had an argument. 

HUME 
(explains) 
We came to see Mom and, well, you 
know, the usual parent-child stuff. 
We wanted to patch it up. 

LAWRENCE 
That's why you were together? 

HUME 
Yes. 

LAWRENCE 
And your father? 

HUME 
My father and my mother broke up 
twenty... one years ago. She hasn't 
seen him since. 

LAWRENCE 
Where is he now? 

HUME 
I don't know. 

LAWRENCE 
Is there anything, you can think 
about it, was there anything unusual, 
anything that might give us a 
direction to pursue? 

Hume shrugs. 

RUSSELL 
She was sick. She had lung cancer. 
She had a mastectomy, but the cancer 
returned. 

LAWRENCE 
How is this relevant? 

RUSSELL 
It isn't. But, I mean, what kind of 
person kills a dying woman? 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME'S HOUSE - NIGHT 

Incense burns at the foot of the shrine. Blue TV light 
flickers from a TV across the room. 

Hume, Russell and Allison, somber, sit watching the videotape 
of Russ' trip. Hume holds a stapled EKG of Russ' minute-by- 
minute progress. 

ON SCREEN: Russell, EKG wires under his smock, IV and cuff 
on his arm, lies quiescent on the Clinic lounge chair. 

RUSSELL 
(watching the video) 
The grass grew and it was like a 
forest, a jungle, there was a 
panther... 

HUME 
(turning pages) 
Minute fourteen. 

RUSSELL 
...the elves lead me out of the 
wood... 

HUME 
There's a lot of literature on elves. 
Terry McKenna had a thing about them. 
Spirit escorts to the Other World. 

RUSSELL 
(watching himself on 
screen) 
There, there, it's starting. I see 
the saucer. I see the light. Blue 
light. She's there. 

ON SCREEN: Russ, turning his seat, says: "Mom." 

RUSSELL 
(back in house) 
My God. 

HUME 
(reading) 
Heart rate elevating. Blood pressure 
up. 

RUSSELL 
She takes me to him. I can see him 
clearly. I see him in every detail. 

Allison reaches over, touches Russ. 

ON SCREEN: Russ, squirming, saying: "Stop, stop." 

RUSSELL 
He places her cross in my hand. 

ON SCREEN: Hume kneels beside Russ. The trip is over. Russell, 
sweating, opens his eyes. 

HUME 
Twenty-one minutes, EKG, blood 
pressure returning to normal. 

ON SCREEN: Hume and Russell exit frame. The screen returns 
to static. Allison, using the remote, clicks off the TV. 
Russ sighs deeply. Silence. 

ALLISON 
(quiet) 
Wow. 

RUSSELL 
I... do you believe me? 

ALLISON 
Yes. 

Russ turns to a reluctant Hume. He extends his right arm, 
holds out his hand, which he has kept balled up, both here 
and in his mother's house, opens his hand, uncurls the 
fingers, reveals his palm: there, on the tender part of his 
palm, is a BURN MARK of a cross, the exact size of his 
mother's gold cross. 

They stare without response. 

Russ, wiping his wet eyes, stands: 

RUSSELL 
I'm going to bed. 

He walks away. Allison waits until Russ' door closes. 

ALLISON 
Do you believe him? 

HUME 
(hesitant) 
Yes, I do, but... 

ALLISON 
But what? 

HUME 
I don't know what it means. 

CUT TO: 

INT. LAWRENCE'S CUBICLE - DAY 

Russell sits beside Detective Lawrence. 

RUSSELL 
What do you mean, no new developments? 

LAWRENCE 
Mr. Rankin, your mother's murder... 
(checks watch) 
occurred thirty-four hours ago. 
Believe me, this is a high profile 
crime. We are employing every resource 
at our disposal-the forensic results, 
a lot of it is still coming through. 

RUSSELL 
But the evidence, witnesses, somebody 
must have seen something... 

Russ' intensity can't help but pique the Detective's interest. 

LAWRENCE 
We've canvassed the neighborhood, 
we're going back, re-interviewing -- 
gone out on the news shows, I'm sure 
you've seen them. When's the funeral? 

RUSSELL 
(corrects him) 
Memorial service. 
(beat) 
Day after tomorrow. 

LAWRENCE 
I spoke with your father. 

RUSSELL 
Huh? 

LAWRENCE 
In England. That's where he lives. I 
was going to have him interviewed 
there, but he's decided to return 
for the funeral. 

Russell falls silent, not knowing what to say or feel. 

LAWRENCE 
You mean he didn't tell you? 

CUT TO: 

INT. GARWOOD'S OFFICE - DAY 

Vince Garwood, wearing a tweed jacket and tie, turning a 
small Incan god in his hands, sits at his desk across from 
Hume Rankin. 

The desk is stacked with research papers; the shelves lined 
with books on chemistry and psychedelic experience. A chart 
on one wall shows the chemical structure of various drugs: 
TMA, MDMA, Mescaline, LSD, etc. A framed photo of Garwood 
and Ethan Rankin as young men sits on the bookshelf. 

VINCE 
I've heard and read a thousand trip 
stories, I've been to a hundred 
conferences, but I've never heard 
anything like this. Glossolalia, 
time and space travel, hyperspace 
healing, eschatological hysteria, 
material transformation, phone calls 
to the dead, being devoured by giant 
cats -- but not this. Are you going 
to write it up? 

HUME 
I haven't decided what to do. You're 
the first one I've told. 

VINCE 
How's Russ? 

HUME 
This whole thing has freaked him. 
Apart from that, he's fine. Hell, 
it's freaked me. It's hard to grieve 
properly with this other stuff hanging 
over our heads. 

VINCE 
I understand. I wish I could put it 
in context for you. 

HUME 
I know this is not something we 
discuss, but have you been in contact 
with my father? 

VINCE 
No, why? 

HUME 
The police located him. He's going 
to come back for the memorial service. 
Doesn't that strike you as odd? 

VINCE 
Yes. 
(refers to Incan God) 
These were once high-tech. 

HUME 
And you've never heard from him, 
about him? 

VINCE 
No, but thinking back, everything 
about your father was odd. There are 
two paradigms for work in this field. 
There are Huxleyites, who believe 
psychotropic drugs are for the 
prepared few. There are those like 
Tim Leary who are popularizers, who 
want everyone to turn on. I'm a 
Huxleyite, Ethan was a Learyist and 
he got terribly burned for it. Leary 
didn't mind when they turned him 
into a clown, in fact, he got off on 
it; but not Ethan. He couldn't stand 
the ridicule, the rejection, the 
cheapening of his ideas. He turned 
his back on the whole thing. I don't 
know what your mother told you, but 
I think this was underneath the 
problems Ethan and Evangeline were 
having. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. FT. STEVENS STATE PARK - DAY 

Fort Stevens State Park, formerly a military reservation, 
sits on a picturesque finger of land between the Columbia 
River and the Pacific Ocean. 

Friends and family of Evangeline Rankin stand under an open 
tent. Her smiling photograph rests on a stand to one side of 
the tent; opposite is a table for refreshments. 

The conservatively dressed mourners stand in ranks as a 
nondenominational MINISTER releases her ashes to the wind 
and sea. The words "Evangeline Rankin" permeate the fog of 
repression. 

A lone trumpeter plays "I Shall be Lifted Up." 

Hume, Russ, and Allison watch beside Ethan Rankin, now 61, 
wearing what can best be described as "gentleman farmer" 
attire. Vince Garwood and his WIFE stands a row back. 

Russ glances at his palm: the cross burn mark is faint, almost 
gone. 

TIMECUT: The bar is open. Friends and family mill about, 
chat quietly, sip wine, coffee and Perrier. 

Ethan, avoiding Garwood, joins Hume and Russ. Allison watches 
as they step away from the others, view the great confluence 
of waters. 

ETHAN 
That was very moving. She was a good 
woman. Better than I deserved. I'm 
glad I came. 

HUME 
I'm glad you did too. Dad. 

Ethan reacts with a self-deprecatory smile: 

ETHAN 
I can't say I've been much of a 
parent. 
(beat) 
I'm going back to Britain tonight. 

This takes the boys by surprise. 

RUSSELL 
Can't you stay a bit longer? 

ETHAN 
(shakes head) 
I almost came back five, six years 
ago, but I did some checking. 
(to Hume) 
You're involved in psychedelics, 
aren't you? 

HUME 
Um-hmm. 

ETHAN 
I went to the library, looked you 
up. Read some of the articles you've 
written. How in God's name did you 
end up in that field? Tell me. 

HUME 
(halting) 
Well, I was pre-med. I wanted to be 
a doctor, just like you. I got 
interested in brain function, how 
neurotransmitters react, why certain 
alkaloids effect the brain as they 
do, which then of course led to 
psychotropic drugs which led me here. 
Just like you. 

ETHAN 
Psychedelics ruined my life and 
they'll ruin yours too. Ruined my 
reputation, ruined my marriage, ruined 
my self-esteem. I have a new life 
now and I want no contact with this 
one. 
(hard: to Hume) 
Get out, Hume. Get out before it 
ruins your life. 
(to both: voice 
cracking) 
Maybe we'll meet again. We'll see. 

Russ and Hume watch as their father, fighting back emotions, 
walks a half dozen steps away, stares out at the ocean. 

Hume turns to his brother, stunned: 

HUME 
Wow. 

RUSSELL 
(lighter) 
Yeah, well, what do you expect from 
a man who names his sons after British 
philosophers? 

CUT TO: 

INT./EXT. HUME'S CAR - DAY 

Hume drives his brother and Allison back to Portland. 

Russell thinking, then: 

RUSSELL 
I still see him. I can see him as 
clear as I see you. 

HUME 
Who? 

RUSSELL 
The murderer. 

ALLISON 
The one inside the saucer? 

RUSSELL 
Yeah. 

Hume starts to reply, stops. 

RUSSELL 
I think we have to do something about 
it. What if he's a known psychopath? 
What if he's killing someone else in 
some other city right now? 

HUME 
What do you propose? 

RUSSELL 
Well, since I have the image so clear 
in my mind, we could go to the police, 
to Detective Lawrence. I'm sure they 
have a sketch artist, you know, a 
sketch kit, then they could take the 
murder's face, see if anybody 
recognizes him. 

ALLISON 
But what if he's not the murderer? 
What if it's just somebody you saw 
somewhere and incorporated into you 
unconscious? 

RUSSELL 
Well, then he'll have an alibi, right? 
(Hume looks unconvinced) 
Hume, I think this is a real person. 
We have a moral obligation to help 
catch him. We have an obligation to 
our mother. 

CUT TO: 

INT. HUME DINING ROOM - NIGHT 

Russ and Hume, in the darkened room, lean across the table 
facing each other. The conversation continues from the 
previous scene: 

HUME 
Okay, we'll do it. We'll call Lawrence 
in the morning. But we've got to 
have the story straight. Russ states 
the "official" version: 

RUSSELL 
During the DMT trial I had a vision. 
I saw Mom bloody, I saw the murderer 
standing beside her, holding a bloody 
butcher knife. Afterwards, we went 
over to her house and found her dead. 

HUME 
Don't tell him about the elves. 

RUSSELL 
No. 

HUME 
Whatever you do, don't tell him about 
the flying saucer. 

RUSSELL 
No way. 

CUT TO: 

INT. POLICE LAB - DAY 

Russ leans beside a female POLICE SKETCH ARTIST working on a 
computer. 

On the screen a face emerges from the many possibilities. 

RUSSELL 
I would say the eyes... show me some 
additional eye choices. 

She brings up a screen full of white male eye matches; he 
picks one. She adds the new eyes -- much better. Almost an 
exact replication of the Murderer's face. Spooky. And 
frightening. 

RUSSELL 
Now the skin color... 

CUT TO: 

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

A utilitarian space: four walls, three chairs and a metal 
table. Lawrence, in a casual mood, sits across from the 
brothers. In front of him is the open case file, Russ' 
statement and the computer-generated sketch of the Murderer. 

LAWRENCE 
You know that expression, "I've seen 
it all?" Remind me not to use it 
again. 
(to Hume) 
Thanks for coming by. I thought it 
would be good to go over it with 
both of you. 
(indicates photo sketch) 
Is this a good resemblance? 

He is, of course, trying to catch Hume unawares. 

HUME 
I would have no idea. I was not 
"there." 

RUSSELL 
It's very good. Almost exact. 

LAWRENCE 
I'll pass it around, very discretely, 
of course, given the circumstances. 
See if it gets a hit. I don't think 
broad dissemination is well-advised. 
I checked with your department at 
the University. Everything about the 
drug trial is apparently on the up 
and up. There won't be any negative 
repercussions. 

RUSSELL 
I think this is him. This is the 
killer. And he's real. I believe 
that, I can't tell you why. 

LAWRENCE 
Why can't you tell me? 

RUSSELL 
It's not that I won't tell you, it's 
just that my reasons are more 
intuitive than rational. 

Lawrence's beeper goes off. He checks it, turns to Russ: 

LAWRENCE 
I hope you're not planning on 
participating in any additional 
trials. 

RUSSELL 
No, sir, I'm not. 

It's not that Lawrence is dense or insensitive, but he's 
from another mindset. The Detective pages through Russ' 
statement: 

LAWRENCE 
Okay, let me go through this again. 
This DMT trip. Let's back up to the 
point where you encounter the "self- 
transforming machine elves." 

Hume looks at Russ incredulously: 

HUME 
You told him about the elves? 

Russell, defensive, replies to Hume: 

RUSSELL 
I had to. Otherwise it wouldn't make 
any sense. How else could I explain 
how I got to the saucer? 

HUME 
(even more incredulous) 
You told him about the flying saucer? 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME HOUSE - NIGHT 

Hume's Camry, his mother's van parked in the driveway. 

CUT TO: 

INT. HUME HOUSE - NIGHT 

A single light burns. Hume, his legs folded in the lotus 
position, meditates before the shrine. He repeats softly, 
"Om mani pene hung, om mani pene hung..." 

CUT TO: 

INT. HAMBURGER KING - DAY 

Russ, wearing his Hamburger King shirt, his Hamburger King 
cap, his "Russell" name tag, takes orders from a gaggle of 
high school students. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CLINIC - DAY 

Hume, Garwood and the Assistants collect EKG data, videotapes 
and notes after another DMT trial. A few participants linger, 
talking amongst themselves. 

Russ steps silently in, raps his knuckles on the door jam: 

RUSSELL 
Hume? 

HUME 
Yeah? 

RUSSELL 
You about done? 

HUME 
(looks around) 
Give me twenty minutes. I'll meet 
you downstairs in the snack shop. 

Russ nods, waves to Garwood, walks away. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CLINIC SNACK SHOP - DAY 

They share coffee and soda water at a table in the upscale 
snack shop: designer coffee selection, croissants and scones, 
vegetarian wraps and snacks. 

HUME 
The police have unsealed Mom's house. 
We have to arrange the disposition 
of her possessions. 

RUSSELL 
How's the trial going? 

HUME 
Good. 

RUSSELL 
No more freak-outs? 

HUME 
No. 

RUSSELL 
I've been thinking. 

HUME 
No kidding. Me too. 

RUSSELL 
The police aren't doing anything. I 
can't say I blame them, not after 
that fiasco with Detective Lawrence. 
I mean, we came off like a comedy 
team. 

HUME 
You've spoken with Lawrence? 

RUSSELL 
I don't have to. Murders like this 
are solved in seventy-two hours -- 
or not at all. Or at least not until 
the killer makes a mistake. It's 
been over a week. There's nothing in 
the papers, on the news. 

HUME 
What makes me think you have something 
in mind? You want me to get a copy 
of the sketch? You want to circulate 
it privately? 

RUSSELL 
No, not that. 

HUME 
What then? 

RUSSELL 
The murderer exists up here. 
(points to his head) 
So does, I imagine, his identity -- 
or at least, clues to his identity. 
There's only one way to access that 
information. That is to return to 
the scene of the identification. 
Learn more about him. 
(beat) 
To take another trip. 

HUME 
There's no way Garwood would let you 
back into the trial. 

RUSSELL 
I know. Besides, I don't want to 
trip at the Clinic. That setting is 
not good -- I'll do it at your place. 
I'll smoke the DMT, not inject it. 
Mix a little Syrian rue to extend 
it. That way the experience will be 
stronger, sharper. 

HUME 
It's illegal. 

RUSSELL 
Drug use is based on loss of control. 
Drug laws are created by those who 
are terrified by loss of control -- 

HUME 
You're preaching to the choir. 

RUSSELL 
You're telling me you can't get DMT 
crystals? This is the Pacific 
Northwest, man. We're in the fucking 
epicenter of drug consciousness. You 
don't even have to go through the 
Clinic. 
(no response) 
Or I should get it on my own? 

HUME 
What do you think will happen? 
(Russ doesn't 
understand) 
When you trip? 

RUSSELL 
I'm going back, Hume. He won't avoid 
me. You know how the hallucinatory 
mind works: you say the word "blue" 
and you see more shades of blue than 
you ever imagined. I'll call him, 
he'll appear -- and when I meet him, 
I'll find out more about him. 
Something we can use. 

Hume exhales, sips his water. 

RUSSELL 
There's no other way. 

HUME 
If you do it -- 

RUSSELL 
I am. 

HUME 
I don't think you should do it alone. 
(beat) 
I'd have to come with you. 

RUSSELL 
You want to meet him? 

HUME 
I wouldn't mind. 

RUSSELL 
Is that a yes? 

HUME 
No. 

RUSSELL 
But you'll think about it? 

HUME 
I'll think about it. 

CUT TO: 

INT. HUME HOUSE - NIGHT 

The "setting" has been prepared: two mats, low indirect 
lighting, a mounted camcorder. 

Russ, wearing shorts and a baggy T-shirt, sits on one of the 
mats. Hume, similarly dressed, places a Goa Trance CD in the 
stereo as Allison labels a video tape, puts it in the 
camcorder. 

Hume takes the Haitian voodoo ceremony painting off the dining 
room wall, turns it, places it on the floor, face to the 
wall: 

HUME 
(explains) 
I'd hate to look at that and up in 
that trip. 
(to Russ) 
I opted to go without any carrier. 
That way the effect will be strongest 
and shortest. I think twenty minutes 
is more than enough. 

Hume carries a box containing a glass pipe, a small vial of 
pale pink powder, herbs, a strainer and a small kitchen knife 
to where Russ sits, places it on the floor, sits beside Russ. 

Trance music -- mantra undulations laid over a gentle techno 
throb -- plays softly. 

HUME 
(to Allison) 
Is the designated driver ready? 

ALLISON 
(nods) 
Why is it the boys get to have all 
the fun? 

Allison checks through the camcorder -- the wide-angle lens 
encompasses both brothers -- presses "record." The red light 
glows. She sits beside the brothers as Hume places DMT powder 
in the bowl of the glass pipe. 

HUME 
(to Russ) 
If you make an object, you say it 
first, then I'll repeat it. 
(to Allison) 
Everything okay? 
(to Russ) 
Relaxed? 

Russ nods. 

HUME 
Pay attention. 

Hume strikes a match, lights the powder, inhaling deeply. 
Hume reacts to the harsh chemical smoke as he passes the 
pipe to Russell. Russ inhales, sets the pipe down, closes 
his eyes. 

Hume, feeling the onrush of drug effect, looks over to 
Allison... 

The crackling, the rising tone AND THEY'RE OFF. Alan Watts 
described the DMT experience as "being fired out of the muzzle 
of an atomic cannon." 

Note: although this is primarily Russ' trip, at times we'll 
see both visions simultaneously on a split-screen. 

The camera snap zooms into each of their foreheads, throwing 
out, in diptych, three time/space tunnels as they tumble 
into the multi-colored VORTEX. 

The two simultaneously tumbling tunnels grow progressively 
white until they merge, the entire screen luminescent, Russ' 
face double exposed beneath: this is his vision. 

We fly across water, jewel-like crystals reflecting off its 
surface. To our right the promontory at Ft. Stevens State 
Park approaches, its earth heaving up, morphing into rolling 
humps in a DESERT, which now surrounds us. 

Except it's liquid. The hump continues to grow, morphing 
snake-like across the surface below. 

No, penis-like. In fact everything is SEXUALIZED. The trailing 
clouds are breasts, buttocks, crotches, nipples. 

The screen caught between male and female imagery, separate 
yet intermixing. Vagina, penis; flower, serpent; yin, yang. 

THROUGH THE CAMCORDER: Russ and Hume lying side by side. 
Russ, left hand feeling his erection, reaches with the other 
hand, touches Allison's leg, which protrudes into frame. She 
removes his hand, places it on his side. 

IN RUSS' MIND: traveling through a world composed of moving 
body parts: hands, fingers, eyes, arms, yet human like some 
multi-limbed Hindu deity. Angel wings flap past as, somewhere, 
a woman speaks to herself. 

Ganesh and the angel, now embracing, break off into a separate 
screen, vanish in the distance as the screens reemerge. A 
hand waves goodbye. 

Russ has forgotten the purpose of his voyage. He says: 

RUSSELL (O.S.) 
Elves. 
(more forceful) 
Transforming machine elves. 

And they appear, at first in the far distance, tiny specks 
on a VAST PLAIN of green. 

We approach. The topography feels familiar: we've been here 
before. It's the high plain from the clinic trip. Below 
mutating elves, bouncing colored balls, wave and smile. 

To our left, the waterfall where dead souls bathe, ahead: a 
recognizable glow. 

THROUGH THE CAMCORDER: Russ and Hume, side by side. Russell, 
focused, says: 

RUSSELL 
The saucer. 
(beat) 
Open the door. 

IN RUSS' MIND: the elves, at our sides, fall away as the 
music grows more troubling, the SAUCER more imminent. 

Evangeline is at the door, bleeding, but we have no time for 
her. Inside the saucer we wander through a maze of 
multilayered blue light. Alex Trebek's voice echoes from a 
TV speaker: "The Taj Mahal, Solomon's Palace and Billy Joel's 
beach house have this in common." 

Russell's voice trails across the screen in colored patterns: 

RUSSELL (O.S.) 
Show yourself. I want to see you. 
(beat) 
Murderer. 
(beat) 
Murderer! 

Suddenly, as if from vapor, the Murderer materializes, wearing 
old jeans and a T-shirt. In one hand is the bloody butcher 
knife, in the other is Evangeline's cross. 

THROUGH THE CAMCORDER: 

RUSSELL 
What is your name? 

Hume, recognizing Russ' voice, repeats the incantation: 

HUME 
Murderer, what is your name? 

IN RUSS' MIND: the Murderer prepares to raise his hand, but 
it is not the hand bearing the cross -- it is the hand holding 
the knife. 

The Murderer steps forward, SLASHING THE KNIFE repeatedly 
toward us, into us. We hear a scream. 

THROUGH THE CAMCORDER: Hume screams as Russ, straddling him, 
STABS his stomach and sides, with the kitchen knife. 

IN THE LIVING ROOM: Allison bolts across frame in a blur, 
screams as she pushes Russ off Hume, onto the floor beside. 

Confusion, panic. 

Allison takes Russ' T-shirt, presses it on Hume's stomach, 
attempting to help him. Hume, groggy, watches. 

Russ, becoming aware of what's happened -- seeing Hume, seeing 
his hands, seeing the knife -- retreats, frightened, across 
the floor. 

CUT TO: 

INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT 

The Camry swerves wildly as it careens around a corner, 
regains control, speeds down a residential street. 

Allison, at the wheel, drives as best she can given her 
frightened condition. 

In the back seat, Russ cradles Hume in his arms. Hume's side 
and stomach are wrapped in bath towels; here and there blood 
seeps through. 

CUT TO: 

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT 

Allison, Hume and Russell burst through the door as one: 
Hume, his towels nearly soaked through with blood, supported 
by Russ and Allison. 

RUSSELL 
We need help. Somebody, please! 

Heads turn. An ORDERLY rushes over to help Hume while a NURSE 
fetches a gurney. 

ORDERLY 
Everything is going to be all right. 

The Orderly and Nurse place Hume on the gurney as ANOTHER 
NURSE says to Allison: 

NURSE 
We need some information about him. 

A uniformed OFFICER and a print JOURNALIST, standing together, 
watch from the waiting room. The Journalist has his note pad 
out. 

JOURNALIST 
(to Officer) 
Isn't that... isn't that the Rankin 
boys, the ones whose mother was 
killed? 

Allison speaks to the Nurse as Russ watches the Orderly remove 
the bloody towels: 

ALLISON 
...not allergic to any medications, 
Hume, Hume Rankin... 

FADE TO BLACK: 

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

FADE IN: a "below the fold" newspaper headline reads: "Sons 
of Murder Victim Involved in Stabbing" and, in smaller 
typeface, "Acid Trip Alleged." The newspaper lies on a small 
table beside a vase of flowers and hospital pamphlet ("When 
Emergency Strikes"). 

Hume rests in a private room, an IV connected to the back of 
his hand. Allison, wearing a Fair Isle sweater, sits on a 
chair beside, reading. 

Hume opens his eyes. Allison, noticing this, stands beside 
the bed. 

ALLISON 
Hi. 

HUME 
I didn't hear you come in. 

ALLISON 
How are you feeling? 

HUME 
Sore. 

ALLISON 
A few more days and you'll be able 
to go home. 

HUME 
Non-life threatening wounds, but, 
Jesus, they hurt. 
(beat) 
Garwood visited yesterday. 

ALLISON 
That was nice. What did he say? 

HUME 
It was what he didn't say. 

ALLISON 
What didn't he say? 

HUME 
He's under pressure. The whole 
department is under scrutiny. I 
offered to resign but he turned me 
down. 

ALLISON 
That's good. 

HUME 
No, what it means is that it will 
look better for the University if 
they fire me. 

She touches his head, straightens his hair. 

ALLISON 
I visited Russell in jail. 

HUME 
You hid the videotapes? 
(she nods) 
How's he? 

ALLISON 
Not good. 

HUME 
God, what a mess. 

ALLISON 
He's fallen inside himself. He's 
absolutely mortified. 

HUME 
You told him I don't blame him? 

ALLISON 
(nods) 
But that's not the problem. The 
problem is that he blames himself. 

CUT TO: 

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

Russell, wearing a blue prison jumpsuit, sits across from 
Detective Lawrence and District Attorney VANTIL. 

Russ' hands rest on the table. He can hardly bear to look 
them in the eyes. 

VANTIL 
We in the DA's office have been back 
and forth about this whole thing. I 
know I said some pretty strong things 
before, but we've reconsidered. 

Russell speaks in a small, broken voice: 

RUSSELL 
I haven't asked for leniency. 

VANTIL 
I don't know if the District 
Attorney's office wants to prosecute 
the son of a recently murdered woman 
who's killer is still on the loose. 
(looks at Lawrence) 
Especially when there is no 
complainant, no reliable witnesses. 
No hard evidence. 
(beat) 
I've spoken with the judge. I'm going 
to propose community service and 
probation, providing you enter a 
court-administered program of therapy. 

LAWRENCE 
Any infraction, any contact with 
illegal drugs, and you'll be right 
back in here. 

RUSSELL 
(contrite) 
My drug taking days are over. No 
more tripping for Russ Rankin. 

LAWRENCE 
You were trying to catch your mother's 
murderer in hyperspace -- do you 
realize how crazy that sounds? 

RUSSELL 
Yeah. 

VANTIL 
We're going to get you some help. 

RUSSELL 
Any developments in the murder 
investigation? 

LAWRENCE 
No. 

RUSSELL 
Nothing from the sketch? 

LAWRENCE 
No. 

RUSSELL 
You know what scares me the most, 
even more than stabbing my brother? 
(they listen) 
It's the fear that this murderer is 
a product of my own projection. That 
I created him out of my own anger at 
my mother, that I took on his form 
and I killed her. 

VanTil looks at Lawrence: this boy does need help. 

LAWRENCE 
It's fortunate you have such a good 
alibi at the time of her death. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 

Hume, Allison and Russell exit the station, walk to the 
parking lot. Hume, still sore, gets behind the wheel. 

Allison and Russ squeeze in; they drive off. 

CUT TO: 

INT./EXT. CAR - DAY 

Hume and Allison are up front, Russ in back. Hume relaxes, 
happy to be out of the hospital. 

RUSSELL 
Allison told me about the University. 
I'm so -- 

HUME 
Please, Russ, I said no more 
apologies. Just stop apologizing. 

RUSSELL 
(apologetic) 
I can't. 

HUME 
I can find another job, even if it's 
sorting specimens somewhere. Or real 
estate. What do you think? Think I'd 
make a good realtor? 
(Allison laughs) 
I know these guys who have started 
up a medical web site. 

ALLISON 
That sounds good. 

HUME 
Yeah, from hyperspace to cyberspace. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME HOUSE - NIGHT 

Camry on the drive. Trance music plays from inside. 

CUT TO: 

INT. HUME HOUSE - NIGHT 

Insert of TV, the trip video: Russ, Allison and Hume lie on 
the mats. Goa Trance plays over. 

Hume, coming in the back door, hears the TV, walks into the 
living room where Russ sits watching the trip video. 

On screen: Allison removes Russ' hand from her leg, places 
it at his side. 

Hume walks over to the video player, ejects the tape. The 
screen goes to static. 

HUME 
Where did you find this? I'm going 
to lock it up. 

Hume turns off the TV. 

HUME 
You're not going to get better 
watching that. 

He starts to walk away. 

RUSSELL 
How am I going to get better? 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME HOUSE - NIGHT 

Russell sits on the front steps, lost in thought. Allison 
opens the door, steps out on the porch, sits beside him. She 
takes our a cigarette, lights it. She offers: 

RUSSELL 
Thanks, no. 

For a moment they just sit looking straight ahead, enjoying 
the evening. 

RUSSELL 
This is where we were sitting. 

ALLISON 
Who? 

RUSSELL 
Me and Hume. We were sitting here, 
just like this, listening to the 
crickets, sipping wine. That's when 
I convinced him to let me in on the 
DMT trial. That's how it all started. 
If we could only go back... 
(she doesn't respond) 
Look, ah during the trip? 

ALLISON 
Yes? 

RUSSELL 
Did you and I, did I... was there 
anything sexual? 

ALLISON 
You were aroused. You touched me. 

RUSSELL 
But? 

ALLISON 
No. You thought we did? 

RUSSELL 
The trip was very... sensual. You 
were part of it. Did you tell Hume? 
I wouldn't want him to think, you 
know, his brother and his girlfriend -- 

ALLISON 
Psychedelics have a strong sexual 
component. You know that. 

RUSSELL 
I didn't have a sister. I've never 
understood women, what makes them 
tick. 
(beat) 
I don't even know what makes them 
shop. 

ALLISON 
(chuckles) 
But it was good, right? It felt good? 

RUSSELL 
This is supposed to help me? 

ALLISON 
There's so much denial going on around 
here, I think somebody ought to tell 
the truth. I've never heard of therapy 
that claimed that denial was the 
doorway to health. 

RUSSELL 
(reluctant, sheepish) 
Yeah, it felt good. I took a puff, 
my arms and legs fell off, the floor 
gave way and the world opened up. 
Until, of course, the very end. That 
wasn't good at all. 

ALLISON 
Well then, think about the good. Not 
the other. 

RUSSELL 
Ally, I like you. I think you're 
fabulous, but I don't want you to 
think... 

ALLISON 
I like you too. I love you. But it's 
Hume I want to give my life to. Why 
can't both things be true? 

He lets this sink in. 

RUSSELL 
I was wondering... 

ALLISON 
What? 

RUSSELL 
(a smile) 
Do you have any sisters? 

She laughs, responds with a mock drawl: 

ALLISON 
No, I'm the only one. 

CUT TO: 

MONTAGE: Life goes on as usual, over music, something by a 
contemporary psychedelic group, such as Flying Saucer Attack 
or Shamen. 

INT. HAMBURGER KING - DAY 

Russell, wearing his uniform, yaks it up with a couple of 
old timers. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

Allison lectures her high school students. On the blackboard 
behind her in bold capitals: "Nineteenth Century Literature -- 
why is it relevant?" and I killed her. 

CUT TO: 

INT. OFFICE HIGH RISE - DAY 

Hume works at a computer cubicle, open texts stacked on his 
desk. A wall logo behind reads: "medicalanalysts.com."

Garwood and the Assistants prepare participants for a drug 
trial.

Russell, seated, listens while JUDITH SALBERG, the court- 
appointed therapist, speaks.

Hume meditates: "Om mani..." 

CUT TO: 

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 

Hume, Allison and Russell pack Evangeline's possessions into 
cardboard boxes, saving some items, discarding others. 

Hume comes across photos of the young Ethan and Evangeline 
Rankin standing in front of their modest home, some alone, 
some proudly displaying newborn sons. 

Hume passes the photos to Russ, who, after looking, hands 
them to Allison. 

CUT TO: 

INT. POLICE CUBICLE - DAY 

Detective Lawrence, on the phone, answers a question from a 
fellow worker. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. FT. STEVENS POINT - DAY 

Russell stands on the escarpment where his mother's ashes 
were strewn, where his father turned away to watch the 
confluence of waters. 

END MONTAGE 

INT. HUME HOUSE - EVENING 

The doorbell rings. Hume walks to the door, opens it: there, 
standing in the failing light, is MIGUEL CHINDOY, an aging 
hippie, long braided hair, wearing a ruana, the short blanket 
favored by South American peasants. 

CHINDOY 
Dr. Rankin? 

HUME 
Yes. 

CHINDOY 
(extends hand) 
I'm Miguel Chindoy. 

HUME 
(declines handshake) 
Okay. 

CHINDOY 
I've read about the events surrounding 
you and your brother. I've come to 
help. I have had twenty years of 
shamanic experience. I believe I can 
help. 

HUME 
Excuse me, who told you to come here? 

CHINDOY 
I am a shaman. 

HUME 
I'm a scholar. What do you want? 

CHINDOY 
I've come to offer my services. To 
help your brother through this 
difficult and necessary passage. 

HUME 
Mr. Chindoy, thank you and fuck you. 
Or is that Senor Chindoy? 
(checks car in driveway) 
So, Senor, get your ass back in your 
rental car and leave us alone. 

CHINDOY 
Dr. Rankin. 

Hume closes the door on Chindoy. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. COLLEGE BAR - DAY 

A beer and TV sports joint on the University strip. 

CUT TO: 

INT. COLLEGE BAR - DAY 

University rowdies cheer a sporting event on wall-mounted 
televisions as Hume and Garwood, tucked into a quiet corner, 
sip draft beer. 

VINCE 
"Miguel Chindoy." His real name is 
Michael Kamen. Born in Brooklyn, 
1946. Poster child for burnout. 
Brilliant student, apparently, but 
then, arrested, discredited, etcetera. 
Eight fries short of a Happy Meal. 
We all talk the psychedelic talk, 
spiel the psychedelic evangelism, 
but there are people who are lost, 
destroyed. We don't like to admit 
it, but it's true. 

HUME 
They keep trying to contact me. I've 
sent back my University mail, I 
changed my mail address, but this is 
the first time someone's tried to 
track me down. 

VINCE 
I'm sorry about the way it came down. 
It was improper, inhumane, and I was 
part of it -- 

HUME 
You had to do what you had to do. I 
don't judge you. 

VINCE 
Don't play the saint. 

HUME 
I'm not. I probably would have done 
the same thing if I were in your 
shoes. 

VINCE 
I just hate having to be the one, 
the proprietor of conservative 
government sanctioned values. 

HUME 
I'm working for an internet company, 
I'm making some money for a change. 
Maybe it was meant to be. 

VINCE 
The trial is going to be great. 

HUME 
I wanted to ask about that. 

VINCE 
We've enough test subjects to start 
collating the results. The final 
paper -- that's a year off -- could 
be quite important. I want to submit 
it to Lancet. I know that sounds 
like a fantasy... 

HUME 
I'm glad. 

VINCE 
How is he? 

HUME 
Russ? 
(Garwood nods) 
Everyone says he's getting better, 
but I don't think so. He's in therapy. 

VINCE 
Court therapy. 
(Hume nods) 
The blind leading the mind. 

HUME 
I've spent a lot of time with him. 

VINCE 
You've spoken with the therapist? 

HUME 
Dr. Salberg? She says he's had a 
"psychotic break." 

VINCE 
You believe that? 

HUME 
(pause) 
I don't know. 

CUT TO: 

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - LATE DAY 

Russell sits across from Dr. Salberg, 45, sincere. A Jungian 
mandala hangs on the wall behind her -- right next to the 
photo of Sigmund Freud. 

RUSSELL 
...it's hard to put into words. 

SALBERG 
It seems to me that at every turn, 
you seek to avoid the underlying 
issues. 

RUSSELL 
Which underlying issues? Okay, let 
me put it in terms you can understand. 
I assumed another form and killed my 
mother. I fucked my brother's 
girlfriend, then tried to kill him. 
Is that Oedipal enough for you? That's 
just what I mean. Whenever this comes 
up, you automatically assume this 
metaphysical weight, strap it on 
your shoulders like some Herculean 
backpack with the implication that 
you're guilty and there's nothing 
you can do about it. You did not 
fuck your brother's sister. You did 
not kill your mother. 

Russell falls silent. 

SALBERG 
Did you? 

RUSSELL 
(quiet) 
Somebody killed her. 

SALBERG 
But not you. 

RUSSELL 
No, I guess not. 

SALBERG 
Have you been taking your medication? 

RUSSELL 
Yeah. 

SALBERG 
It's been three weeks. You should 
feel something. Can you detect any 
change? 

RUSSELL 
No. 

SALBERG 
You still have suicidal feelings? 
(no answer) 
I would like to change your 
medication. It's an exploratory 
process. 

She picks up a script pad, starts to write: 

SALBERG 
Prozac is a relatively mild drug. A 
friend of mine calls it the penicillin 
of psychiatry. It's not working and, 
frankly, I only hoped it would. I 
want to try something else... 

CUT TO: 

INT. HUME HOUSE - AFTERNOON 

Hume, followed by Allison, opens the front door and, setting 
down his keys, reacts with shock at what he sees: the house 
has been trashed, burglarized. 

He looks around: furniture tossed this way and that. The 
Buddha toppled over, the shrine desecrated. 

ALLISON 
My God, Hume... 

She picks up the video player which has been tossed to the 
floor. They stand in a sea of discarded books. 

Hume goes into the KITCHEN. 

The refrigerator door is open, the cabinets exposed. There 
he sees, amid the maliciously discarded food supplies and 
dining utensils, a once locked cabinet, now chopped open, 
its lock ripped out. 

Hume examines the cabinet -- its contents tossed hither and 
yon. 

ALLISON 
What is it? 

HUME 
I locked it here. 

ALLISON 
What? 

HUME 
The video tape. The trip tape. 

CUT TO: 

INT./EXT. VAN - NIGHT 

Russell, driving home, listens to rap on the car radio. 

The music distorts. Russell feels something strange. He looks 
side to side. It suddenly feels like he's driving too fast. 
He slows his mother's van to a crawl, turns off the radio. 

He sees something darting in the distance, something in the 
trees between one house and the next. 

Russ pulls the van to the curb, stops. Shuts off the engine. 
Silence. 

He gets out of the van, closes the door. 

Looking apprehensively, he steps forward... 

Then he sees him: THE MURDERER, the Murderer from the blue 
light saucer, tucked behind a distant tree. The Murderer 
scans the landscape. 

Russ devises a method of escape. If he dashes to the right, 
hides behind a tree, then slips between two houses, he can 
avoid the Murderer. 

He runs. He escapes. 

Ahead: Hume's house. He's home. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME HOUSE - NIGHT 

Russ, composing himself, walks up the steps. 

CUT TO: 

INT. HUME HOUSE - NIGHT 

Russell enters to find Hume and Allison cleaning up the living 
room mess. Russ attempts to appear the voice of reason: 

RUSSELL 
Jesus, what happened? 

HUME 
We were burglarized. 

RUSSELL 
How? 

ALLISON 
Some creep broke in. That's how. 

RUSSELL 
What'd he take? 

HUME 
I don't know. We're still looking. 

Russ looks at the toppled Buddha: 

RUSSELL 
Why would he do that? 

HUME 
I don't know what's missing. Nothing 
valuable. We didn't have anything 
fucking valuable. 

RUSSELL 
It's my fault. Ever since -- 

HUME 
Would you fucking get off that! 

Hume replaces the Buddha on its pedestal as Russ drifts into 
the kitchen. He calls out: 

RUSSELL 
What's with this guy? He's got a 
thing for Special K and Wheat Thins? 

Hume and Allison join him in the KITCHEN. Russ, suddenly 
pale, points to the splintered kitchen cabinet. 

RUSSELL 
What was taken? 

HUME 
What do you mean? 

RUSSELL 
From the cabinet. The locked cabinet. 

They are reluctant to answer. 

RUSSELL 
What? 

HUME 
That's where I'd put the tape. 
(Russ: huh?) 
From the trip. 

Russ starts manically pacing: 

RUSSELL 
He's found us, he knows we're onto 
him. 

ALLISON 
Who? 

RUSSELL 
The murderer! 

HUME 
Russ, stop it! 

RUSSELL 
You think it's some sort of joke, 
right? Well, fuck both of you! He 
knows about all of us, he knows about 
the police sketch, he knows 
everything! It's evidence. Lock the 
doors! We've got to get some guns, 
protect ourselves. He wants to kill 
us, because we know who he is! 

Allison goes over to Russ, attempts to hold him: 

ALLISON 
We'll sort it out in the morning. 

HUME 
I'll call the police. 

RUSSELL 
(disdainful) 
Right, like they're going to do 
anything. 

HUME 
There's been no real damage. 

ALLISON 
You're exhausted. You look fried. 
Now is not the time to jump to 
decisions. 

Her embrace calms him. 

RUSSELL 
Yeah, I suppose. 
(beat: weepy) 
I don't know what gets into me. 

HUME 
Are you all right? We can take you 
somewhere. 

RUSSELL 
No, no, I'm just tired, worn to the 
bone. Every little thing, I don't 
know why, sets me off. 

HUME 
You need sleep. 

RUSSELL 
I know, I know. 

Hume looks out the window, toward the driveway and street. 

HUME 
Where's Mom's van? 

RUSSELL 
It ran out of gas. I left it several 
blocks back. 
(off Hume's puzzled 
reaction) 
I walked. I'll get it in the morning. 

ALLISON 
You're going to be all right? 

RUSSELL 
I'm fine. I just need some sleep. 

He starts for his room. 

RUSSELL 
You want me to help clean up? 

HUME 
We got it under control. 

Russ nods, staggers away. Hume and Allison look at each other 
as he walks off. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME HOUSE - MORNING 

Allison, outside, waits at the curb as a friend stops her 
car. She gets in, the car drives off. 

CUT TO: 

INT. HUME HOUSE - MORNING 

Hume and Russ, at the kitchen table, finish morning coffee, 
peruse a scattered newspaper. Russ, resigned, sets down his 
cup: 

RUSSELL 
Well, I guess I better go track down 
the car, pick up some gas. 

Hume, checking his watch, watches Russ exit. The door slams. 

Assured he is in the house alone, Hume stands and -- checking 
the window -- walks to his brother's guest room. 

Hume looks around his BROTHER'S ROOM. Where to start? 

Everything seems normal: Russ' dirty clothes thrown into a 
corner, bed sheets unmade, a book (Stephen Wright's Non Zero) 
overturned on the bed table beside an empty glass. 

Recently recovered photos of his mother, father, himself and 
Russell on the bureau. These cause Hume to hesitate, but he 
continues: opening drawers, going through the closet, looking 
under the bed. 

And there, under the bed, hidden, he finds it: the trip video 
tape. 

His fears confirmed: it was Russ who "broke in," trashed the 
house, desecrated the shrine, stole the video from the kitchen 
cabinet. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON 

Hume watches, waits as high-schoolers stream from the two 
story building. 

Then Allison appears, walking beside a fellow teacher, joking. 
She sees Hume beside the Camry, walks over, embraces him: 

ALLISON 
What a surprise. You're my "crossing 
guard" now? 

HUME 
I love you. 

ALLISON 
Oh, that feels good. I love you too. 

HUME 
Get in the car. 

She, sensing something of import, opens the passenger door, 
gets in. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CAR - DAY 

They sit in the Camry. Hume makes no attempt to start the 
car. She waits apprehensively. 

HUME 
I searched Russ' room. I found the 
video tape. 
(beat) 
There can be no other explanation. 
It was Russ. He broke into the house, 
he trashed everything. 

ALLISON 
He claimed it was the murderer. 

HUME 
You know what this means. 

ALLISON 
He's no longer in control. 

HUME 
He's my brother. I love him. 

ALLISON 
He needs help. 

HUME 
Fuck help. I know about the help 
he's getting. 

ALLISON 
Is he in danger? 

HUME 
What should I do? 

ALLISON 
No, that wasn't like a casual 
question. That was a real question. 
Is he in danger? Are we in danger 
from him? Can he hurt us? 

HUME 
(pause) 
I don't know. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HAMBURGER KING - DAY 

A fast food joint in a row of fast food joints. 

CUT TO: 

INT. HAMBURGER KING - DAY 

Slow day: a few workers, moms and kids. 

Russell, cap and name tag in place, flirts with a pretty, 
intellectual COED. He holds up a french fry: 

RUSSELL 
The french fry. My occipital lobe 
sees it, my temporal lobe says "yum," 
my parietal lobe says, "I'll eat 
it," my prefrontal lobe says, "I'll 
bite it," my motor cortex does so... 
(takes bite of french 
fry) 
...my somesthesic cortex supervises 
and my brain is thrilled. 
(Coed laughs) 
My brother taught me that. 

COED 
But I don't eat fried food. 

RUSSELL 
To each her own. 

COED 
You're a strange sort of guy to be 
working at a place like this. 

RUSSELL 
Well, I'm working my way up to middle 
management. 

COED 
(laughs again) 
I'm working my way up to a grilled 
chicken sandwich and a diet coke. 

RUSSELL 
That we can do. 

Russ turns to order a grilled chicken sandwich, turns and 
smiles at the Coed. Then he sees: past the Coed, past the 
brightly colored tables, moms and kids, through the window, 
lurking outside, wearing old jeans and clean T-shirt, the 
MURDERER beside a four-wheel drive pickup. It's a face he 
knows well, one he can't forget. 

The Murderer walks toward the entrance, turning his head, as 
if looking for someone. 

Russ turns his head away, says "I'll be right back" to a 
fellow worker as he scoots into the kitchen area. The Coed, 
baffled, watches. 

He ducks out a side door, circles surreptitiously along the 
SIDE OF THE BUILDING. Peeking around the corner, he sees the 
Murderer just standing there by the concrete table and chairs, 
hands on hips, looking around. 

The Murderer, turning his back to Russ, decides to go inside. 

Russ inches closer, following him. 

The Murderer ENTERS Hamburger King. Russ slips through the 
door behind him. 

The Murderer scans the room: he's looking for someone. 

Russell makes his move. Taking a running start, he charges 
toward the Murderer, tackles him at the waist, drives him 
against a chair, then onto the floor. 

Russ is now atop the Murderer, turning him over. Patrons 
stop mid sentence, mid meal, look speechlessly -- as if in a 
slow motion dream. 

Russell pummels the Murderer's face, blow after blow after 
blow. 

A child screams. 

A male employee and two patrons rush over. They pull Russ 
off the Murderer. 

The Murderer's face is bruised, starting to bleed. He is 
terrified, BUT: he is not the Murderer. 

In fact, it's not even a man. It's a woman. 

Commotion, chaos. Someone calls out, "Call the police." 

Russ, restrained by the employee and patrons, looks at the 
"Murderer." He can't understand how his face transformed 
into this bloodied female visage. 

CUT TO: 

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY 

Hume and Allison sit across from Salberg. 

SALBERG 
They initially gave him haloperidol -- 

HUME 
Haldol? 

SALBERG 
Yes. 

HUME 
My God. 

SALBERG 
It's out of my hands, Dr. Rankin. 
It's not my case. It's up to the 
staff at the psychiatric hospital. 
But I would imagine they would 
prescribe orally administered 
Thorazine, at least until they can 
be sure he's not a danger to himself 
or others. 
(beat) 
I'm sorry I wasn't of more help. I 
knew he was delusional but I didn't 
think he was hallucinational. He 
sees things. 

HUME 
Of course he sees things. Just because 
they put him in an institution doesn't 
mean he's going to stop seeing things. 

SALBERG 
He has deeply unresolved issues 
concerning his father -- and his 
mother. And you. 

HUME 
(derisive exhale) 
And Thorazine is going to fix that? 

SALBERG 
Thorazine will block the 
hallucinations, but, in all the 
literature, it's never proven 
effective against delusions. 

ALLISON 
In other words, he'll still believe 
in his delusions, he just won't see 
them? 

SALBERG 
Yes. But, as I said, it's no longer 
my case. 

HUME 
Have you ever considered this: Russ, 
because of his use of psychedelics, 
has passed through the doors of 
perception, gained access to another 
reality and for one reason or another 
is unable to integrate this reality 
with his present state? 

Allison gives Hume a look, places her hand on his arm -- now 
he's sounding crazy. 

SALBERG 
That's called schizophrenia. And 
it's not treatable. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE - DAY 

A bucolic campus setting belied by a sign reading, "Glenview 
Psychiatric Institute." 

CUT TO: 

INT. VISITING ROOM - DAY 

A day has passed. Allison and Hume visit Russell, wearing 
institutional whites, in an artificially "homey" room. 

Russ struggles to have a normal conversation, counteracting 
the effects of the Thorazine like a wrestler in a hold. He 
sips from a glass of water: 

RUSSELL 
(to Allison) 
You can smoke here, you know. It's 
ironic. In all of Portland, there's 
no place you can have a smoke, but 
here it's all right. I guess they 
figure we got nothing to lose. 

ALLISON 
No, I'm fine Russ. 

HUME 
I'm trying to help you, but 
unfortunately, you've fallen into 
the great maw of the legal system. 
We've hired a lawyer, a psychiatric 
advisor -- 

RUSSELL 
He came. 

HUME 
It's all paperwork and bullshit. If 
I had a prayer, it would be, "God, 
let me never fall prey to the US 
criminal justice system." 

ALLISON 
You must not lose faith. We're here 
for you. You are loved. 

Russ' hands tremble. He restrains them. 

RUSSELL 
It's just these side effects, these -- 
what's the word? 

HUME 
Extrapyramidal disorders. 

RUSSELL 
Yeah, that and the dry mouth. 
(beat) 
I want to be normal. 

ALLISON 
We know. 

RUSSELL 
I'm worried. 

HUME 
Why? 

RUSSELL 
Him. 
(no response) 
The murderer. I can't get out of 
here. He must have figured out by 
now where I am. I'm not exactly 
protected in here. He could slip in, 
you know, wearing a uniform, find 
me, kill me. 

HUME 
I don't know if it's possible, but 
you need to make an effort. The mind 
is an extraordinarily powerful organ. 
You can, Russ, if you apply your 
mind, wipe all the events surrounding 
Mom's murder out of your mind. You 
can make the murderer disappear. 

Russell, not responding to his brother's plea, sips water, 
shifts subjects: 

RUSSELL 
I think time is a thing. It's not an 
abstraction. Time not only changes, 
but there are different kinds of 
time -- 

HUME 
Russ, this is interesting but it is 
not where we should be concentrating 
our efforts. 

An INSTITUTIONAL AID sticks his head into the room, withdraws. 

HUME 
I guess that's a hint. 

RUSSELL 
(looks at bare wrist) 
If I had a watch, I could tell you. 
They must have some exciting activity 
planned. 

Russ motions Hume close, speaks into his ear: 

RUSSELL 
(urgent) 
Get me out of here. He's going to 
find me. He's going to kill me. 

Hume kisses his brother on the cheek, stands. 

RUSSELL 
(to Allison) 
Ally, when you get outside and into 
the car, do me a favor. 

ALLISON 
What? 

RUSSELL 
Smoke a cigarette for me. That's 
what's nice about being crazy. You 
smoke out there, I can taste it in 
here. 

She smiles, nods. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. GARWOOD'S HOUSE - DAY 

Hume and Vince Garwood stand outside a pleasant post-war 
home in South Park. Garwood's wife works in a bricked-off 
flower garden. 

VINCE 
Let's take a walk. There's a little 
park up the way. I find that when 
something really heavy is weighing 
on you, it's good to walk. 

They nod to Vince's wife, head down the sidewalk. 

HUME 
I'm losing my brother. They got him 
on Thorazine. It's all maintenance 
crap. His mind is melting. 

VINCE 
I know. 

HUME 
Huh? 

VINCE 
I have contacts at Glenview, people 
I've consulted with over the years. 
I've asked about Russ. 

HUME 
You know you grow up with a brother, 
all that sibling shit, you don't 
think much about it. Of course we 
were close, not having a father, but 
I never realized how much I loved 
him until all this happened. 

VINCE 
I've been thinking about it too, in 
ways that probably go far and beyond 
what you're thinking. Ways that go 
back to your father, to the very 
reason I got involved in this 
discipline. You know how it is in 
this dreadful field. You get into 
psychedelic drugs, you have to be 
prepared to give everything else up. 
The medical establishment turns its 
back on you, any hopes you had of 
wealth are gone; of the people who 
take you seriously, half are fucking 
crazy. You do it because you believe 
in it. You believe that this sad 
planet, if there is any hope for it 
all, its hope lies in some primal 
reconnection with psychotropic plants. 
Every religion, you trace it back, 
you find a bunch of primordial men 
sitting around a campfire chewing 
leaves. 
(beat) 
I went to see your brother. 

HUME 
You did? 

VINCE 
Yeah. I mean, off the record. I feel 
responsible. 

HUME 
You're not. 

They reach a small pocket park, sit on a bench. 

HUME 
What do you think? 

VINCE 
Are you prepared to hear what I really 
believe? 

HUME 
At this point, I'm prepared for about 
anything. 

VINCE 
Your brother has had what others 
would call a "psychotic break," and 
it's not a condition that's going to 
be improved by conventional medication 
or therapy. I see no hope in that 
direction. 

HUME 
We're losing him. 

VINCE 
This has caused me to go back through 
the literature, tests, theories. I 
guess what I'm proposing is 
psycholytic therapy. 

HUME 
"Psychedelic therapy." No one's done 
that for years. It's been discredited. 

VINCE 
It was not discredited. It was 
criminalized. Extraordinary things 
were being accomplished, Stanislav 
Grof, Humphrey Osmond, but then came 
the anti-establishment movement, the 
popularization of LSD and the Big 
Crackdown. Psycholytic therapy just 
stopped. No one wanted to lose their 
license. 

HUME 
This is what happened to my father? 

VINCE 
(continues) 
There is a Shaman down the Amazon 
from Iquitos, near the 
Peruvian/Columbian border, Don Macita. 
He works with the ayahuasca vine. 
Your father and I tripped with him 
many years ago. We correspond from 
time to time. His books of imagery 
are essentially the same as what 
Russ describes. He's been doing this 
all his life. He works in the jungle, 
using the old ways, which is the 
best way to experience these primal 
drugs. It's the only way to ingest 
heroic doses of psychedelics -- in 
their natural context. It has the 
added benefit of being legal. 

HUME 
Define "heroic." 

VINCE 
If you're talking about ayahuasca, 
the mother of all harmala alkaloids, 
I'd say, oral dose, five, six hundred 
milligrams. I'd have to talk to Don 
Macita. 

HUME 
That's life threatening. 

VINCE 
There are different ways to mix the 
actual brew, which then effects the 
nature of the journey. I don't think 
we should wait. Much longer, it may 
be too late. 

HUME 
Wait a second. You're assuming I've 
already signed onto this "back to 
the jungle" scheme. 

VINCE 
I would need your support. 

HUME 
I'm sorry. You don't have it. 

CUT TO: 

INT. RUSSELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 

Russ, shivering, sits squeezed into the corner of his room. 
Sweat beads his forehead, his pupils are dilated. 

Every noise from outside, from the corridor, from the rooms 
above is magnified in his mind. He is struggling to hold on 
to his sanity. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME HOME - NIGHT 

Just a normal house on a normal block. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

Light filters in from a street lamp. Hume and Allison lie in 
each other's arms. It's as if they must hold on to each other 
for dear life because they're all they have left. 

HUME 
There was an inmate at a prison for 
the criminally insane and he told an 
interviewer, "It's easy to make the 
cops think you're crazy. All you 
have to do is act crazy all the time." 

She laughs. He kisses her. 

HUME 
I wonder if the same is true about 
sanity. All you have to do is pretend 
you're sane all the time. 

ALLISON 
In that case, you've got me fooled. 

HUME 
There is such a thin tissue separating 
one reality from another, from here 
and now to somewhere else and some 
other time. Somewhere this is not 
happening to us, but we are here and 
it is now and it is happening. 
(looks to ceiling) 
When we had the wake, when we 
distributed my mother's ashes, my 
father came over and spoke to me. He 
said, "Psychedelics ruined my life 
and they'll ruin yours." 

ALLISON 
Father knows best. 

Hume emits a short derisive snort. 

ALLISON 
What did Garwood want? 

HUME 
What do you mean? 

ALLISON 
He called, you went over. 

HUME 
(thinks) 
It was nothing. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE - DAY 

Hume and Allison turn up the leafy drive. Several police 
cars are parked out front. 

They park, pass the police cars, head inside. 

CUT TO: 

INT. PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE - DAY 

Hume and Allison step up to the main reception desk, speak 
to a RECEPTIONIST in a white uniform. 

HUME 
I'm Dr. Rankin. We have a two o'clock 
visitation with Russ Rankin. 

RECEPTIONIST 
Just a moment. 

They wait as the Receptionist speaks into the phone. The 
entrance area is designed to be hospitable, but, looking 
closer, one realizes that beneath the benign surface is a 
high security institution: multiple locks, triple depth glass. 

The corridor door opens with a buzz. A hospital ADMINISTRATOR 
and a uniformed POLICE OFFICER approach them. 

They realize something is wrong with Russ. They greet: 

ALLISON 
What's happened? It's Russ, isn't 
it? 

ADMINISTRATOR 
Dr. Rankin? 
(Hume nods) 
I'm Dr. Fielding. 

POLICE OFFICER 
We've been trying to reach you. 

HUME 
We were running errands. 

ADMINISTRATOR 
Don't you have a cell phone? 

ALLISON 
We don't like cell phones. 

The Administrator lets this (her attitude) pass: 

ADMINISTRATOR 
I'm afraid, ah, we can't find your 
brother. 

HUME 
What do you mean, "can't find him?" 
He's in a lock down ward. 

ADMINISTRATOR 
At morning call, the attendant brought 
him breakfast. The room was empty. 

ALLISON 
Could he be hiding in the building 
somewhere? 

POLICE OFFICER 
Security is going through every room, 
ward, office. 

ADMINISTRATOR 
We are interviewing the staff. Someone 
let him out. There's no other 
explanation. You haven't heard from 
him? 

HUME 
No. 

ADMINISTRATOR 
Any idea where he might be? 

HUME 
None. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. GARWOOD'S HOUSE - DAY 

Hume rings the Garwood doorbell. Mrs. Garwood answers. 

HUME 
Mrs. Garwood. 

MRS. GARWOOD 
(smile) 
Hume. 

HUME 
I need to speak to Vince. I tried at 
the University. 

MRS. GARWOOD 
He left. 

HUME 
I don't understand. 

MRS. GARWOOD 
There was a phone call. Somebody at 
a conference dropped out and they 
asked Vince to fill it. He packed, 
grabbed his passport and headed for 
the airport. 

CUT TO: 

INT. HUME HOUSE - NIGHT 

Music plays over as Hume, pulling the curtains, looks out 
the front window at an unmarked police car across the street 
with two PLAINCLOTHESMAN sitting in front. 

He turns back into the room, walks over to Allison. He speaks 
softly, telling her about Garwood. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. DETECTIVE AGENCY - DAY 

The sign on the window reads: "Lennon's: We'll Find It" with 
a cartoon of a detective type holding an oversized magnifying 
glass. 

Through the window: Hume and LENNON, 30, lean over a computer 
manned by a teenager computer NERD. 

CUT TO: 

INT. DETECTIVE AGENCY - DAY 

Lennon speaks as they look at the screen: 

LENNON 
It took a bit of doing. Your friend 
didn't go direct. Portland to Mexico 
City, re-ticket to Bogota, to Quito, 
to Iquitos. 

HUME 
Any other passengers? I mean any 
passenger on the same flights with 
Garwood. 
(to computer Nerd) 
Can you do that? 
(the Nerd goes to 
work) 
Used to be, in the day, you had 
expenses, man hours, gumshoes, now 
it's just a computer and a teenager 
with a knack to hack. 

NERD 
Here's a reappearing name for the 
first two flights. "John Russell." 

Garwood's voice starts over as the Nerd continues to work: 

VINCE (V.O.) 
To the people of the Amazon basin, 
all life is determined by countless 
spirits and beings who live "on the 
other side." It is essential for 
their own survival to be able to 
enter that world and interact with 
those spirits to secure well-being 
for oneself and one's family... 

CUT TO: 

INT. IQUITOS COFFEE SHOP - DAY 

Garwood and Russell sit in a coffee/snack shop in Iquitos, a 
frontier jungle city of 350,000 inhabitants in Southeastern 
Peru. 

Outside, along the single-story streets, motokars (motorcycle 
taxis), emit clouds of pollutants as they pass. Inside, 
mestivo kids, wearing Nikes and NBA T-shirts, play X-men 
combat video games. Not exactly one's preconception of 
"Amazonia." 

Garwood continues speaking as Russ sips coffee, bites from a 
bread roll. 

VINCE 
...They get this protection through 
the ayahuasca ceremony. The 
preparations, drinking the brew, the 
visions, the assistance of an 
ayahuasquero, a shaman. Huasca means 
vine, aya means souls or dead people, 
so it's the vine of the dead or the 
vine of the spirits... 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HUME HOUSE - DAY 

Hume and Allison, wearing jeans, nylon jackets, hiking boots 
and backpacks, exit, nod to the Plainclothesmen in the car 
across the street, get into the Camry and drive off. 

Hume's voice over picks up where Garwood's left off: 

HUME (V.O.) 
...it's in the elite company of the 
most powerful naturally occurring 
psychotropic drugs, the harmaline 
alkaloids: ayahuasca, psilocybin, 
yage, iboga. DMT is the active 
ingredient in ayahuasca. Chacruna, a 
natural MAO inhibitor, makes it orally 
active, extends the effect. It's 
essentially a very long DMT trip... 

CUT TO: 

INT. PORTLAND AIRPORT - DAY 

They stand at the American Airlines counter. 

HUME (V.O.) 
...nothing prepares you for it. It's 
the great unknown. The drug looks 
inside you and takes you there. The 
Jungian maps don't apply. Your chakras 
are of no use. It's a big forest and 
there are no markers on the trees. 

CUT TO: 

INT. AIRPORT WAITING AREA - DAY 

Allison, sitting next to Hume, asks: 

ALLISON 
It's dangerous? 

HUME 
No. That's the reason I support 
naturally occurring psychedelics. If 
they were dangerous, their use 
wouldn't have endured this long. 

ALLISON 
But is it dangerous for Russell? 

CUT TO: 

EXT. THE AMAZON - DAY 

Vince and Russ sit in a canopied river boat as it putt-putts 
down river. Around them sit mestivo peasants, a tourist couple 
and a local business type. 

Garwood's voice over resumes: 

VINCE (V.O.) 
Don Macita, the shaman we will meet, 
he's over seventy now, has a camp in 
the jungle. He believes the body is 
full of toxins and these toxins will 
emerge as demons unless purged. The 
preparations include four days of 
cleansing, external and internal, 
diet and meditation. It involves a 
sort of mud bath, drinking a diuretic 
tree sap, oye, eating yucca and rice. 

Russ turns to Garwood, says: 

RUSSELL 
But I thought the ayahuasca brew is 
purgative. 

VINCE 
It is. The first couple hours, "la 
purga," is vomiting and shitting. 
The visions will start at this time. 

RUSSELL 
You're taking this? 

VINCE 
We both are. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. IQUITOS AIRPORT - DAY 

Hume and Allison, tired, emerge into bright Amazonian sun. A 
line of motokars vie for their attention. Garwood's voice 
resumes: 

VINCE (V.O.) 
We will use this period to concentrate 
on our goals. We will define your 
areas of conflict, define the person 
you want to be when the journey 
ends... 

CUT TO: 

EXT. IQUITOS - DAY 

Hume and Allison stand in Plaza de Armas, approach likely 
strangers, struggle with their Spanish, get replies. 

VINCE (V.O.) 
...At first you will feel like you're 
dying. You'll have to endure this. 
That's what the drug is about: dying 
and living... 

CUT TO: 

EXT. DON MACITA'S CAMP - DAY 

Garwood and Russell approach the Amazonian encampment. It's 
virtually unchanged from forty years before. The Ceremonial 
House stands in the distance. 

And, ahead, beside the river, the small figure of Don Macita. 

VINCE (V.O.) 
...You will enter the wholeness of 
being. You will feel a satisfaction 
like you've never known... 

Don Macita turns, looks. Vince waves to him. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. LA BOULEVARD/IQUITOS - DAY 

Hume and Allison negotiate with a guide on the riverside 
walk. Charter boats wait. 

VINCE (V.O.) 
...First come the patterns, then 
plants, then animals, then fantastic 
architecture, the little people, 
they are guides -- and, at some point, 
the serpent. Don't be afraid. He is 
a passage... 

CUT TO: 

EXT. AMAZON - DAY 

Hume and Allison ride down the river. 

VINCE (V.O.) 
...and the end, well, it will be 
idiosyncratic. It will be what you 
are... 

CUT TO: 

EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY 

Vince and Russell stand, nude, as huito, a bluish fruit pulp 
mixed with clay, is poured, rubbed over their bodies by Don 
Macita and his native ASSISTANT. The same blue that caked 
Garwood years before. 

VINCE (V.O.) 
...The brew is made by mixing crushed 
ayahuasca vine with alternating layers 
of chacruna leaves and boiling them... 

CUT TO: 

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 

Garwood, Russ and others watch as Don Macita, 77, selects a 
section of the climbing ayahuasca vine, instructs his 
Assistant which portion to cut with his machete. 

VINCE (V.O.) 
...the duration, including the 
purging, will last six to eight hours, 
although the intensity will slack 
off after four or five hours. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. ENCAMPMENT RIVERSIDE - DAY 

Hume and Allison step off the river boat, look around. A 
path leads to the Ceremonial Hut, the open MAIN HOUSE hung 
with hammocks. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. CEREMONIAL HOUSE - DAY 

Garwood and Russell watch as Don Macita and his Assistant 
prepare the ayahuasca brew: crushing strips of vine, laying 
them in an old metal pot. 

Atop the small table, like forty years before, sits the 
ceremonial bowl, its sides painted and repainted over the 
years with fantastic imagery, rainbow bands of brightly 
colored unreal creatures. 

Hume and Allison approach. Garwood greets them 
enthusiastically: 

VINCE 
Hume! Ally! 

HUME 
What are you doing here? 

VINCE 
Same thing you're doing here. 
(to Don Macita) 
Don Macita, this is Hume Rankin, 
Russ' brother I told you about. 

Hume exchanges greetings with Don Macita as Russ walks over, 
whom, he in turn greets. Hume turns to Vince, speaks softly, 
censorial: 

HUME 
We need to talk. 

VINCE 
Sure. 

Allison, taking the hint, says to Russell: 

ALLISON 
Show me around. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. ENCAMPMENT RIVERSIDE - DAY 

They stand at the edge of the Amazon, brown slow-flowing 
water, perhaps fifty meters wide. Around them, the jungle 
vibrates with life. 

HUME 
What you've done is illegal. I could 
report you. You could go to jail. 

VINCE 
If that has to be, it has to be. 
Just wait until we've done what we 
can for Russ. There's a program. 

HUME 
You absolutely baffle me. 

Garwood glances to the Main House where Allison and Russell 
walk, talk. 

VINCE 
I've done a lot of things I regret 
in my life, and a lot of the things 
I regret involve your family. When 
your father was vilified, when the 
witch hunt hit, he came to me for 
support and I turned my back on him. 
I protected my position. He left the 
country, left his family. I took the 
easy way when letting them fire you. 
Now this. I feel my life is defined 
by the sadness in your family. I 
believe I can help your brother. He 
was dying in there. 
(a beat) 
It's so good you're here. 

HUME 
Why? 

VINCE 
To help Don Macita. 

HUME 
You're tripping as well? 

VINCE 
(nods) 
I wasn't sure before, but now I am. 
I want to apologize to your father. 
His spirit is all around here. Come, 
you've got to talk to Don Macita. 
We'll go over the counseling -- 

HUME 
Don't you think I ought to talk to 
Russ first? 

CUT TO: 

EXT. MAIN HOUSE - DAY 

Hume and Russell sit inside the hammock strung house. 
Generations of visitors have left inscriptions and painted 
mystic, hallucinatory symbols (the Third Eye, the Serpent) 
on the beams and benches. 

HUME 
I brought along your meds, just in 
case. 

RUSSELL 
You're kidding. That stuff is poison. 
It's poison for the brain. 

HUME 
I know, I know, I just felt it would 
be irresponsible not to. I didn't 
know what condition you would be in. 

RUSSELL 
That last night in the sanitarium, I 
was holding on, just barely, 
concentrating every atom in my body 
to remain sane, like those kids in 
"Nightmare on Elm Street" trying not 
to sleep. Then I heard the door open -- 
he had come for me, the murderer, 
but it was Professor Garwood. 

Pause. 

HUME 
How are you now? 

RUSSELL 
All this cleansing and my 
conversations with Don Macita have 
cleared my mind. Everything is now 
directed toward the journey. I am 
prepared. I want to do this. 

Hume gives his brother a loving look, then a big embrace, 
which is returned and held. 

HUME 
You're not going in anger? 

RUSSELL 
No. 

HUME 
Remember this journey you're taking, 
this drug, what it's doing it's doing 
for your benefit. Pay attention. It 
wants to help you. 
(Russ nods) 
You know how I like to say they're 
not recreational drugs? That's not 
true. They are recreational. Re- 
creational. You must re-create your 
life. Remake it, heal it. 
(Russ nods again) 
If you get lost, if you get 
frightened, if you're in danger, 
repeat the mantra. If you hear me 
saying, "Om mani pene hung," you'll 
know that I'm with you, you're not 
alone. 

Hume reaches in his pocket and hands Russ a small souvenir 
replica of an elf-like Incan god, much like the one Garwood 
had in his office. 

HUME 
Russ, take this. I bought this in 
Iquitos. It didn't cost anything. 
It's supposed to bring good luck. 

Russ tucks it into his pocket: 

RUSSELL 
If only it were that easy. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. CEREMONIAL HOUSE - SUNSET 

Garwood and Russell, wearing white ceremonial ruanas, sit 
where Vince sat with Russ' father years before. Don Macita 
ladles out the ayauasca brew into two cups on the table. One 
cup contains almost twice as much brew as the other. 

Don Macita blows purifying smoke on Garwood and Russell. 

Allison and Hume sit to the side. He puts his arm around her 
shoulders. 

Russ looks at his fingernails: they are rimmed blue from the 
purifying dye. 

Don Macita places the cup with the larger dose in Russell's 
hands, the other in Vince's, then steps and begins to sing 
the soft, lilting icaros: "Maimandara shamuirimum, Yana puma 
chicunaca..." 

TIMECUT. Night. Garwood and Russell both bent over a long 
basin, vomiting. "La Purga." 

Russ watches his vomit as the camera zooms toward his eyeball, 
enters his myriatic pupil. 

INSIDE RUSS' MIND: his vomit emerges as blood, covering the 
floor, liquefying it. In the blood swim thousands of vibrating 
worms. 

The characteristic crackle, the rising hum (DMT particles 
crashing into the brain's synapses) as the worms, animated 
like sperm, jump bullet-like from the bloody below, pierce 
our skin. 

The voyage has begun. 

Russell's pupil expands, revealing the vast geography of 
hyperspace. 

Space first appears as GEOMETRIC FORMS, revolving 
kaleidoscopically. 

These quickly assume vegetable form, an inviting cardinal 
red CHRYSANTHEMUM, its petals beckoning, becoming a white 
LOTUS blossom. 

Into the blossom we fly, its core opening onto the JUNGLE 
canopy. 

We fly over the jungle, compelling images filling our field 
of vision: birds unlike any ever beheld, rippling trees and 
fauna, indistinguishable creatures in the undergrowth. 

To our left: the waterfall where dead souls bathe. 

We are the panther. We know this because we hear the panther's 
heart beating, hear its paws pounding the earth's surface, 
see its paws before us. 

We dive toward the surface. Into the jungle the panther 
plunges. 

But it is not a jungle, it is an OCEAN and we are under the 
water now, swimming shark-like alongside pink dolphins and 
glowing fish of the deep. Great primordial creatures, sea 
monsters extinct for eons, pass. 

We burst from the ocean Atlantis-like into a realm of RUINED 
PALACES and LABYRINTHINE CITIES. Empty unpopulated empires 
rise and fall. 

African mud cities become Palantine temples; pyramids become 
decayed skyscrapers. 

Throughout melodies mix with the music, snippets of sound 
contemporary and archaic. A guitar riff from the Fifties, a 
bit of Beethoven, third world instruments. 

Then, for a moment, above the ruins: a cascade of ADVERTISING 
IMAGERY: the pop culture of signs, slogans and logos rushing 
past. 

In the ruined cities, we enter the HALL OF ANCESTORS. We see 
our shadow before us, morphing the history of earth's life 
forms: sea-going, reptilian, mammalian, ape-like, humanoid. 

The ancestors are stacked in high-rise rows to our right and 
left. All of mankind's faces, Neanderthal, Homo-sapien, 
yellow, white, black -- some surprised, some merely curious -- 
morphing one to the other like falling dominos. 

At the top level, we notice, are the gods -- primitive, 
ancient unrecognizable divinities yielding to more familiar 
figures: the Egyptian hierarchy, the Greek pantheon, Nordic 
gods and goddesses, the manifestations of Buddha, the Hindu 
cosmology, Mohammed and his followers, Christ and the saints -- 
yet, looking closer, we see they are in pain, all writhing 
like crucified Jesuses. Not gods, daemons. 

We grow frightened: 

RUSSELL (V.O.) 
Hume, Hume... om mani... 

IN THE CEREMONIAL HOUSE: Hume cradles his brother, repeating 
with Russ: 

HUME AND RUSSELL 
...pene hung, om mani pene hung... 

INSIDE RUSS' MIND: we burst from the Hall of Ancestors, fly 
over a great SAVANNA. 

There we see them, first as mottled dots, growing larger as 
we near: the self-transforming machine elves. 

And they see us. Recognizing our approach, they emit a 
communal joyful "ahh." The sound's after-image sails across 
the savanna like a green shooting star, trailed by a 
chartreuse neon echo image. 

The elves bounce brightly colored balls or are brightly 
colored balls. It's hard to tell, because they constantly 
transform into the balls, back into themselves. Garwood's 
voice echoes: 

VINCE (V.O.) 
They are guides. 

Saucers fly in a flurry overhead like comets: oval shaped, 
then chrysanthemum, then lotus, then oval again. 

Coming closer, walking amongst the elves, they offer us gifts: 
they toss their colored balls, which, as they touch us, turn 
into extraordinary objects: iridescent Faberge eggs, morphed 
by the sound of their voices into essences whom, it seems, 
are ideas themselves. 

It feels wonderful. 

All of which distracts us from a distant specter approaching 
at warp speed: the great speckled serpent. Time motion clouds, 
speed overhead, transforming the savanna into an endless 
DESERT. 

It's the rapacious serpent from Ethan Rankin's jungle trip. 
The serpent's jaws open wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp 
teeth, a crimson red mouth. 

RUSSELL (V.O.) 
Om mani pene hung... 

We try to escape but cannot. We plunge past the teeth, down 
the esophagus, into the belly of the beast -- the "animistic 
roller coaster ride." 

IN THE CEREMONIAL HOUSE: Hume and Don Macita sit beside Russ. 

HUME 
Where are you? 

INSIDE RUSS' MIND: down and down we tumble, past reptilian 
ribs and pulsing organs. 

We suddenly emerge amidst a blaze of color, not in a Mexico 
City rave club, but in a blue throbbing room. We are in the 
SAUCER. 

Multi-dimensional walls of mutating shades of blue surround 
us. Up, down, right, left, each indiscernible from the other. 

Alex Trebek's voice: "The Taj Mahal, Solomon's Palace and 
Billy Joel's beach house all have this in common." 

Growing, in the distance, a woman lying on a hospital bed -- 
is she being operated on or giving birth? We know it's our 
mother, but do not say that word. 

A heavy metal grate falls before us, keeping the woman out 
of reach. 

The Murderer materializes through the grate, wearing, as 
before, jeans and a T-shirt. 

His face, however, seems different: cruel, mean, distorted. 
In his hands he tosses two balls: the miniature heads of 
Hume and Russell. 

The Murderer's eyes ooze puss, blood drips from his ears and 
nostrils. His expression is demonic. 

Behind him, through the grate, the hospital room, now red, 
is a torture chamber: a Boschian tableau of medieval pain 
and suffering. 

The woman in the hospital bed lies next to wretched creatures 
on racks and wheels. Black hooded inquisitors lean over her 
chest, employ instruments of torture. 

The Murderer squeezes the miniature heads as his own head 
swivels, Exorcist-like, on his base. He is now Ethan, insects 
crawling from every facial orifice. 

In his hands the knife and cross. 

We are terrified. The music is terrifying: discordant noise 
and a cacophony of angry indistinguishable voices. In the 
distance, Hume's voice struggles to be heard: 

HUME (O.S.) 
Om mani pene hung... 

And also, somewhere in the music, a repeat of an earlier 
voice: "What is your name?" We try to repeat the mantra, but 
the words come out wrong. 

Ethan's head swiveling again, revealing our own image, Russ' 
face, who is now, suddenly upon us, knife upraised, slashing, 
slashing. 

Russ' chest opens, he is inside us. 

We stand in a HALL OF MIRRORS, our image reflected over and 
over again. We are The Murderer, we are Ethan. 

And behind us, in every duplicating reflection, behind the 
iron grate, the red chamber of horrors -- and a woman's 
scream. 

Our reflection stands at the door, preventing entry. 

A tug at our side: it's one of the smiling elves. He offers 
us a colored ball. We look again, the elf is gone. 

The brightly colored ball glows, continually morphing human 
and animal images, ancient and contemporary. 

We throw the ball at our reflection, hitting first one 
reflection, then the others in a rippling chain effect. 

Our image transforms into an angry mass of wasps, which, 
buzzing, fly away, diminishing in size until they are nothing 
more than faint gold crosses in the distance. 

The cacophony subsides, a voice emerges from the chaos: 

VOICE 
They were all built for love. 

The grate lifts with a Mozartian cresendo. The torture chamber 
is again shifting shades of blue. 

We walk to the hospital bed, pull back the sheet which covers 
the woman on the bed. 

Her chest is exposed X-ray-like: ribs, a beating heart and 
lungs. And, in one lung, a diseased black cancerous clump, 
crawling with maggots. 

We reach in, forcefully yank out the clump, toss it heavenward 
where it bursts into brightly geometric forms, flies away. 

The woman on the bed -- she is our mother -- smiles: 

EVANGELINE 
Russell. 

A blue dot appears on her forehead like a Third Eye. Music 
welcomes us as we move toward the dot until it fills our 
field of vision. 

We hyper-zoom into the blue dot, earth. Recognizable 
configurations appear, North America, the Pacific Northwest, 
Oregon, Portland, downtown... 

Until the dot is nothing but a large human eye. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CLINIC - DAY 

Lights come up on a reostat. Hume, wearing a blue button 
down collar shirt with a dark tie, in the lounge chair. 

An Assistant extracts the IV line from Russ' arm prepares to 
remove the EKG sensors. 

Garwood steps over as the Assistant goes to help another 
participant in the DMT trial. 

HUME 
How do you feel? 

It takes a moment for Russ to orient himself. 

VINCE 
How was it? 

RUSSELL 
(thinks) 
Idiosyncratic. 

VINCE 
That's the amazing thing. Every 
experience is absolutely unique. 

Russ, still somewhat stunned, stands, says to Hume: 

RUSSELL 
Let's go over to Mom's house. I want 
to apologize for that stunt I pulled 
the other day. 

HUME 
You're still groggy. And you've got 
to do the questionaire. 

RUSSELL 
Yeah, but after. 

HUME 
Sure. Okay. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 

The Camry and van in the drive. 

CUT TO: 

INT. MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 

Day old cut flowers sit in a vase. 

Evangeline, Hume and Russell sit across from each other, 
cradling cups of Kona coffee. 

"Jeopardy" plays on the TV in another room. 

EVANGELINE 
It's so amazing you came over. I was 
just getting ready to call you. 

HUME 
What happened? 

EVANGELINE 
It's hard to explain. 
(they wait) 
Dr. Klein called. He had gotten the 
latest x-rays. I didn't understand. 
I called him back to be sure. He 
repeated it. 
(voice cracks) 
The tumor is diminishing. It's 
responding to treatment. It's almost 
gone. 

The boys stand, embrace her jointly. 

HUME AND RUSSELL 
Oh, Mom. 

HUME 
It's miraculous. 

RUSSELL 
I'm so happy. 

EVANGELINE 
I love you boys. 

RUSSELL 
Me too. 

HUME 
I can't wait to tell Ally. 

Russ reacts to a particularly loud burst of applause from 
the TV: 

RUSSELL 
How can you stand to have that thing 
on all the time? 

EVANGELINE 
It's just background noise. It's 
comforting. 

Russ steps into the DEN, turns off the TV, interrupting Alex 
Trebek mid-sentence. 

Russ feels something in his jeans, reaches in his pocket, 
pulls out a small replica of an elf-like Incan god. He doesn't 
know quite what to make of it. 

Then he looks at his fingernails: they are rimmed pale blue 
with a clay-like substance. 

Hearing his mother's voice, he returns to the LIVING ROOM. 

EVANGELINE 
Come, boys, sit with me a while. 
Just hold my hands. 

They sit beside her, take her hands. 

EVANGELINE 
Let's enjoy what we have while we 
have it. Reality is so fragile. 

THE END
