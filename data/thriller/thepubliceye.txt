FADE IN: BEGIN TITLES 

In murky light, a piece of paper sinks in a shallow tin tub. 
By degrees, faces and forms appear on the page: a swooning 
woman, (circa 1940) a cop who tries to catch her, a crowd of 
onlookers standing in the shadows of a tenement house in the 
aftermath of a murder. Before the photograph has completely 
developed, it seems to fade in a dreamy 

DISSOLVE TO: 

Another submerged page. A new images begins to appear: a 
thick-ankled stripper (again, 1940) sleeping between shows 
in her dingy dressing room. Before it has fully developed, 
this photo also 

DISSOLVES TO: 

A new page on which appears a billboard attached to a burning 
building. It advertises a 1930's sunburn medication: "Put 
out the flames with SunzoCaine!" Painted flames rises from a 
sunbather's burnt back, mixing with the real ones. 

We continue sensuously to DISSOLVE THROUGH black and white, 
high-contrast photos as they come hauntingly to life (all of 
them depicting New York, at night, in the late 30's or early 
40's) till we END TITLES. 

We PAN TO the dim red darkroom bulb, under which we begin to 
hear a faint siren and 

DISSOLVE TO: 

...another red bulb, this one atop a patrol car. 

EXT./INT. POLICE CAR [APRIL, 1942] - NIGHT 

We hear a Dispatcher's monotonous voice over a hissing police 
radio. 

DISPATCHER (V.O.) 
Signal 30. Two-three-six Thompson 
Street. 

Inside the car, the Young Cop who's driving angles forward 
in his seat, pressing heavily on the gas. 

His older partner stares forward, blankly. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. 236 THOMPSON STREET - SAME 

A respectable working-class block. Neighbors are clustered 
by the stoop in robes, pajamas, undershirts. A woman with 
young children holds them to her nightgown. All watch as The 
Cops pull up by the curb and rush from their squadcar. They 
push their way through the crowd. 

TEENAGER 
(in an undershirt, 
grinning) 
Third floor. 

The Cops continue into the building. 

INT. STAIRWELL - 236 THOMPSON 

The Cops move stealthfully up the dim stairwell, guns drawn. 

On the third-floor landing, a door is ajar. Light spills out 
onto the floorboards. 

As they ascend, the Cops can see the corpse of a smartly 
dressed young man inside: 

It lies face down, its features rudely pressed and bloody 
against the floor. A freshly-blocked hat lies a few feet 
from the dead man; he was shot as he came home. 

On the landing, the Cops move carefully to the door, hugging 
the wall. 

They hear someone moving inside the apartment. They freeze, 
barely breathing. 

The older Cop cocks his gun, crosses himself, wraps his hand 
around the doorframe. He jumps into 

THE APARTMENT 

crouching, gun drawn. A crackling, blistering sound is heard 
as a flash of light fills the room, blinding him. 

COP 
(blinking as he stands) 
Jesus. 

REVERSE: 

A flashbulb hits the floor hollowly. 

BERNZY (whose real name is Leon Bernstein and whose 
professional name is "The Great Bernzini") inserts a new 
bulb in the giant chrome flash attachment of his Speed Graphic 
press camera. A cigar is planted in the corner of his mouth. 

Bernzy cuts a curious figure: He wears an oddly oversized 
suit that has capacious pockets to accommodate camera lenses, 
film plates and flashbulbs. His thick-soled shoes are sensible 
to a fault. He wears a hat but no tie. 

His face is alert and ironic, his movements rapid and 
purposeful. 

BERNZY 
(to the Cop, deadpan) 
You scared me. 

He reaches into his jacket to extract a new 4 x 5 glass film 
plate (from a bag of plates hung over his shoulder) with a 
well-practised, unhurried speed. 

The older cop, O'BRIEN, is annoyed; his comment sounds like 
an accusation. 

O'BRIEN 
We weren't six blocks from here when 
it come over the radio. 

Bernzy is lining up another shot; he speaks from behind both 
cigar and camera. 

BERNZY 
I killed him. To get the pictures. 

The Young Cop has entered. Bernzy waves him back. 

BERNZY 
You're casting a shadow. 

He backs up, obligingly. Bernzy takes his shot. 

The Young Cop kneels by the corpse. He finds a gun in the 
waist-band of its suit trousers. 

YOUNG COP 
(to O'Brien) 
Second one this week. 

O'BRIEN 
(to Bernzy) 
Who'd this guy work for, Bernzy? 

But Bernzy hears a car pulling up outside, a car door 
slamming. He peers down into the street through the window. 

BERNZY'S POV: 

Another Photographer is arriving. He crosses the street, 
lugging a press camera. 

O'BRIEN 
Bernzy! 

BERNZY 
I think Farinelli. But he's not 
lookin' his best tonight... Could 
you move his hat closer? 

O'BRIEN 
What? 

BERNZY 
His hat. The hat. People like to see 
a dead guy's hat. 

O'Brien grudgingly picks up the hat, drops it closer to the 
corpse. 

The flashbulb fires. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 

Bernzy, in the alley alongside the building, is hunched over 
the open trunk of his sedan on a camp stool. 

The car trunk has been turned into a darkroom. The truck 
lamp has been replaced with a darkroom bulb. A drying line 
is suspended over a shallow tub. (Also in the trunk are two 
dozen boxes of Wabash super-flash photo lamps, an open box 
of cigars, a pot of glue, various cameras and lenses, and a 
tiny, battered typewriter.) 

Bernzy looks up into the apartment window as the explosion 
of a flashbulb-fills the window. 

Bernzy unpins four nearly dry photos on the line, fans them 
in the air, lays them face down on the trunk floor, and stamps 
their backs with his identifying imprint: 

Deco lettering is surround by the stamped outline of an eye, 
like something on an optometrist's sign. Around the upper 
and lower lids of the eye it says "CREDIT PHOTO TO - THE 
GREAT BERNZINI". In the center of the eye it says "THE PUBLIC 
EYE" 

He slams the trunk shut. 

CUT TO: 

INT. DAILY NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT 

CLOSE ON a Daily News check, made out to Leon Bernstein. On 
a stub, the check is carefully accounted for. 

1 Corpse (2 bullets @ $1.50 each)............$3.00 

Bernzy, riding down in an elevator, folds the check into his 
pocket. 

INT. DAILY NEWS LOBBY 

The elevator doors open, Bernzy steps out. 

The Photographer we saw leaving Thompson St. steps into the 
lobby. 

He only has to see Bernzy to know he's too late. 

PHOTOGRAPHER 
Shit. 

CUT TO: 

INT./EXT. BERNZY'S SEDAN/STREET - NIGHT 

Bernzy drives, his eyes intently scanning the nighttime 
street. 

A steady, low hiss is emitted from a police radio, that is 
gerry-rigged under his dusty dashboard, swaying on its wires. 
A metal plate on the radio says FOR POLICE VEHICLES ONLY. 

Bernzy's Speed Graphic, with flash, sits on the seat next to 
him. 

As Bernzy reads every shadow and doorway for potential 
pictures, 

We see what he sees out the window (buildings and people) in 
black and white, slightly overcranked: the POV of Bernzy's 
trained eye. 

CUT TO: 

INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT 

On the landing of the stairwell, a young Puerto Rican Woman 
wails hysterically as two Cops try to calm her down. She's 
in her nightgown. A flashbulb fires over her. 

The narrow stairway is packed with Policemen and Puerto Rican 
neighbors in their T-shirts, pajamas and robes. 

A COP leads two Ambulance Attendants, with a stretcher, up 
the stairs shouting as he goes. 

COP 
Clear the way, get back, c'mon, c'mon, 
c'mon -- 

Now he passes Bernzy, near the top of the stairs -- 

COP 
Bernzy, clear outta here. 

Bernzy is taken aback -- 

BERNZY 
But I hear this guy's walkin' around 
with a meat cleaver in his head -- ! 

-- as if it's every man's God-given right to photograph such 
a rare sight. 

COP 
Get the Hell out. 

As the Cop heads into the Woman's apartment, he speaks to 
the ambulance Attendants, but looks at Bernzy as he does so. 

COP 
Throw a sheet over him. 

The Cop is suspiciously keen to thwart Bernzy: Bernzy smells 
something. 

He turns to a Puerto Rican MAN, the next door neighbor, who 
watches in his T-shirt and boxers. 

BERNZY 
Who is this guy, anyway? 

MAN 
(Puerto Rican accent) 
Working for the Mayor. Visits at 
night. 

Bernzy sizes up the elements of the tragedy as the Orderlies 
bring the victim out of the apartment. He looks at the 
hysterical mistress and then at her victim/paramour, who is 
covered with a sheet, but moving (with a comically high 
protrusion where the meat cleaver is lodged). 

Bernzy -- his eyes as keen as a fox's -- takes a last look 
at the covered stretcher -- not a good picture -- then heads 
quickly down the stairs. 

EXT. TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT 

Bernzy opens the cavernous trunk of his car. He sorts through 
a cigar box containing various tools of the photographer's 
trade, including a scissors he uses to crop prints. He picks 
up the scissors. 

He strips off his coat. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. TENEMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 

The Attendants load the stretcher into the back of the waiting 
limousine. People watch, Bernzy not among them. 

One of the Attendants climbs in back, the other gets in the 
front, next to the Driver. 

The ambulance pulls out. Siren. 

INT. AMBULANCE - SAME 

Bernzy sits in the back of the ambulance. He has cut a square 
in the back of his jacket collar, then put the jacket on 
backwards, to simulate a clerical collar. 

BERNZY 
(to the Attendant) 
Better uncover him, son. 

The Attendant complies. We don't see the corpse, but the 
handle of the meat cleaver juts up ludicrously into the frame 
and it moves back and forth as the victim moans. Even Bernzy 
is taken aback. 

BERNZY 
Jesus. 

Not the thing a priest would say; he crosses himself to cover. 

Bernzy begins to mutter piously, indecipherably, over the 
ailing man. He waves something over the man, like a bottle 
of Holy Water when the last rites are administered. 

We see what he's waving: a light meter. Still muttering, 
Bernzy reads the meter. 

The Attendant looks perplexed -- a dawning realization. 

ATTENDANT 
...Wait a second. 

From his oversized pocket, Bernzy withdraws a 35 mm camera. 
He gets his shot fast, before the Attendant can react. 

SHOCK CUT TO: 

EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

A Man in a hat watches as the ambulance comes to an abrupt 
halt. The Man watches as The back doors open and a "priest" 
spills out -- half leaping, half pushed. The "priest" lands 
on his ass in the street (careful to protect his camera) as 
the Attendant slams the ambulance doors. 

The ambulance takes off again. 

The "priest," unfazed, dusts himself off as he hails a cab 
with a cheerful serious determination. 

BERNZY 
Taxi! 

As the cab squeals away with the "priest", the Man in the 
hat wonders what he just saw. 

CUT TO: 

INT. PHOTO DESK - DAILY MIRROR - NIGHT 

A photo editor, EDDY, studies the picture of the meat-cleaver 
victim (we don't see it). 

EDDY 
This is a new low, even for you, 
Bernzy. 

BERNZY 
Flatter me all you want. It's still 
twenty dollars. 

EDDY 
You got a release on this guy? 

BERNZY 
You got a spirit medium on staff? 

EDDY 
You checked with the hospital? 

Bernzy nods. 

Eddie opens the big ledger-style checkbook, starts to write 
the check. 

BERNZY 
Didn't even make it to Bellvue, poor 
bastard. Thank God I was able to 
administer his last rites. 

CUT TO: 

INT. ALL-NIGHT DRUGSTORE - NIGHT 

In black and white, overcranked, we watch a Sailor and his 
Girl necking in the rear-booth of a drugstore. 

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) 
That's not very polite. 

At normal speed, in color, we see Bernzy, sitting at a booth 
near the counter of the drugstore, staring at the young 
couple. He has a cup of coffee, a plate of eggs and his camera 
on the table. 

Bernzy, caught staring, looks up at the WOMAN. 

WOMAN 
I know what it's like. I work nights 
myself. 

She takes a seat across from Bernzy. 

She has plain, well-scrubbed features, and wears a raincoat. 
A Nurse and a Doctor are at the next booth. 

BERNZY 
Professional interest... 
(he puts the camera 
to his eye) 
See? 

WOMAN 
(ignoring this) 
Break-time comes, there's nobody to 
talk to, you feel lonely, right? 
(a beat) 
How much you got on you? 

Bernzy looks at her a beat before picking up the camera again. 
He shoots the Girl and the Sailor, rather than answer her. 

BERNZY 
'Tomorrow He Sails' -- That's the 
caption. 

WOMAN 
C'mon, how much? There's no harm in 
it. 

BERNZY 
My wife wouldn't like it. 

Bernzy throws a dollar on the table, collects his camera: 
he's in a hurry to get away. Meantime: 

WOMAN 
Honey, you're not married and you 
don't have a girl: I saw how you 
were looking at those two. 

Bernzy gets up to go. 

WOMAN 
Your socks don't even match. 

He pretends not to hear her, as he heads for the door. She 
Calls after him, with a plaintive sweetness. 

WOMAN 
Oh, c'mon -- come back!... It's lonely 
out there! 

CUT TO: 

INT./EXT. BERNZY'S SEDAN/STREET - NIGHT 

Bernzy drives, his gaze unflagging. The Dispatcher 
monotonously intones a series of drab numbers on the hissing 
radio. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - DAY 

The police radio continues to hiss, O.S., without 
interruption, as we pan Bernzy, asleep on top of his bed. 
He's curled up in his clothes. 

Still panning, we see the apartment. It's exceedingly 
cluttered -- as unkempt and eccentric as its occupant. The 
shades are drawn against daylight. 

On the crowded table Bernzy uses for a desk, there is a 
payroll check from Time, Inc.: 

TWO MURDERS. . . . . .$35.00 

Pinned to the bulletin board over the desk, there are covers 
from the New York Daily News, Mirror, World-Telegram, Post, 
Sun and Journal-American, all featuring Bernzy's photos of 
classic tabloid subjects: fires, corpses, handcuffed hoods. 

Piled against a wall are two four-foot-tall stacks of cigar 
boxes with masking tape labels across their front flaps. 
These are marked with laundry pencil: "Vagrants," "Drunks," 
"Strippers," "Rich & Poor," "Coney Island," "Gangsters - 
Dead," "Miscellaneous Crowds," "Bowery - Night," "Gangsters - 
Live." 

Still panning, we see a series of photos clothes-pinned to a 
laundry line. They show the Bum, sleeping in the box: he 
seems isolated and diminished in the high contrast of the 
Speed Graphic photo -- a bright island in a sea of blackness. 

Pulling back from the photo we see the photos of the curled 
up bum in the foreground and Bernzy curled up on his bed in 
the near distance, the police radio on his nightstand. 

We begin to hear Big Band music over the hissing as we 

CUT TO: 

EXT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT 

We hear the Big Band music as we see a red awning lettered 
LOU LEVITZ'S CAFE SOCIETY. It shows the club's trademark 
since the 30's: a squat coffee cup (a remnant of Prohibition, 
when gin was served in the guise of legal beverages). 

On the sidewalk outside the polished revolving doors, there 
is a crush of out-of-towners who wait to enter, dressed in 
their best. But they'll never be let in. 

A few Tabloid Photographers, behind a velvet rope, grip their 
big cameras, waiting for celebrities to come or go. One of 
them spots Bernzy as he threads his way through the crowd. 

PHOTOGRAPHER 
Hey, Bernzy, y'just missed Eleanor 
Roosevelt French-kissin' the Aga 
Kahn. 

BERNZY 
(still moving) 
I'll catch 'em inside. 

PHOTOGRAPHER 
That'll be the day. 

Bernzy approaches the beefy Irish doorman, in red livery, 
who mans the ropes. 

DOORMAN 
Behind the ropes, Bernstein. 

Bernzy parks his cigar in his mouth and extracts a piece of 
paper from the inside pocket of his ill-fitting suit. 

The Doorman reads a handwritten note on Lou Levitz's personal 
stationery. In a woman's hand: "Danny, Please direct Mr. 
Bernstein to my office, Mrs. Levitz." 

As the Doorman reads, a patrician-looking Couple in evening 
clothes push their way to the front. 

DOORMAN 
Evening, Mister-missus Armstrong. 

The Doorman lifts the rope. Mr. Armstrong slips him a bill 
as they pass through. Bernzy starts to follow, but the Doorman 
hooks the rope before he can pass. 

He looks over at the other Photographers, as he hands Bernzy 
back the note. 

DOORMAN 
Kitchen door. Check the camera. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT 

The band music swells, O.S., as the kitchen door swings open 
and a Waiter exits, tray in hand. It stays open as a Chinese 
Bus Boy points Bernzy in the direction of the hat check, 
across the front of the club. 

CAFE SOCIETY - HAT CHECK 

Bernzy, all eyes in this New York Mecca, takes up the claim 
ticket for his camera, steps down into 

CAFE SOCIETY - MAIN ROOM 

The big band plays on a bandstand, raised and set back from 
the tables. A black SINGER is performing, whose double 
entendres and risque stage manner lend a cultivated air of 
the illicit to things. 

In Cafe Society, as in The Stork Club or El Morocco, the 
seating arrangements clearly denote the "importance" of 
guests: 

The dreaded Outer Circle belongs to rich but garrulous 
businessmen with flashy dates or wives in furs. The Middle 
Circle is for show biz types, pretty women, professionals, 
the up-and-coming. The coveted Inner Circles comprises the 
well-born and the famous, e.g., Social Register types, stars 
of Broadway, prize-fighters and movie stars. 

Every table has a white cloth, a red rose and a ceramic 
ashtray that says LOU LEVITZ'S CAFE SOCIETY. Those who eat 
eat steaks or chops. Everyone drinks champagne or Scotch. 
Everyone smokes. 

Bernzy's eyes drink in the rich atmosphere. They seem to be 
taking photographs without benefit of a camera: DOYENNE WITH 
GIGOLO, FAT MAN OGLING CIGARETTE GIRL, ACTRESS IN SUNGLASSES, 
etc., again through the black and white of Bernzy's trained 
eye, overcranked. 

The MAITRE D' approaches Bernzy, intending to evict him; his 
eyes scornfully size up Bernzy's clothes, his overall 
demeanour. He has an Italian accent. 

MAITRE D' 
You have reservations, sir? 

BERNZY 
I can see you got some. 

The Italian looks at him, utterly perplexed by the idiom. 

BERNZY 
Forget it. 

Bernzy shows him the note from Kay. Recovering from his gaffe, 
the Maitre d' bows his head graciously. He crosses to a 
section at the back of the room where The club's Hostess -- 
a beauty -- is pointing out salient features of the room to 
a delegation of men in business suits (not evening clothes.) 

She charms them all with some witty remark. As they laugh, 
the Maitre d' points out Bernzy. 

She excuses herself, crosses to Bernzy. She looks impossibly 
elegant next to him, or he looks impossibly unkempt next to 
her. 

KAY 
Thanks for coming, Mr. Bernstein. 

BERNZY 
Bernzy. 

KAY (Mrs. Lou) LEVITZ is in her early 30's, a dancer/actress 
plucked from some show or chorus by her husband years ago, 
now groomed like a rich lady. 

Bernzy follows her toward a set of stairs at the back of the 
club. As they move, she looks across at the men in suits. 

KAY 
Those're Publicity men from the War 
Department. They wanna shoot a 
newsreel in here for War Bonds. 

INT. NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - SAME 

They enter. She closes the door behind them. The music is 
still audible from downstairs, but muted. 

A professional Hostess, in full control of her charm, she 
immediately crosses to a drinks caddy and pours him a Scotch. 

KAY 
There's never been a camera inside. 
Lou always said "It's like Heaven, 
that way: they're dyin' to see it." 

Bernzy smiles, but he looks ill-at-ease, holding his hat. 

The back wall of the office has a big curtained window that 
looks down on the nightclub. Memorabilia lines the other 
walls. 

Bernzy is studying a photo-portrait of Kay -- a professional 
glamour shot from her show business days. He looks at a framed 
photo of Kay with the late Lou Levitz -- squat, bald, nattily 
dressed. 

She hands him the Scotch and indicates the short couch. 

KAY 
Please. 

He sits at one end. She sits at the other. The shabbiness of 
his clothes is especially apparent in these sleek 
surroundings. He's still uncomfortable. It shows. 

KAY 
Is everything alright, Bernzy? 

BERNZY 
I'm still in shock. 

She doesn't understand... 

BERNZY 
If I'd of snuck in, I'd feel more 
comfortable. 

KAY 
(a slow smile) 
Me too. Half the people down there 
feel more sure they belong than I 
do. 

Now he smiles, half-disbelieving. He takes a cigar out of 
his pocket. 

BERNZY 
You mind? 

KAY 
(she shakes her head) 
Lou told me you know everybody in 
New York, Bernzy: all the crooks and 
all the cops... 

He shrugs modestly as he unwraps his cheap cigar. 

KAY 
And he said you never take sides, 
because all you care about is getting 
pictures: taking sides might get in 
the way. Please -- take one of Lou's. 
They're just going t'hell here. 

She opens a humidor on the coffee table and takes out a big 
Cuban. As she hands it to him, she seems to study him. 

BERNZY 
Thanks. 

KAY 
I guess you've read about Lou's 
brother contesting the will. If 
Lou'd've wanted to leave Cafe Society 
to a rug salesman, he'd of left it 
to him. 

BERNZY 
He sells toupees? or carpets. 

KAY 
It's hard to tell. 

He smiles, she smiles... She grows more serious. 

KAY 
People say some pretty lousy things 
about me, Bernzy: she's a cold-hearted 
girl who married and buried an old 
man. You've heard that? 

Bernzy looks at her. He shrugs. 

KAY 
I loved my husband. I love this place. 
It's mine now... It's mine. 

She seems to want some affirmation of this fact. 

BERNZY 
Right. It's yours, now. 

She gets up abruptly and walks to the window overlooking the 
club. She draws back the curtain with her hand. 

KAY 
D'you know this man? 

He joins her at the window. He looks down: 

A young, dark-faced Man, whose heavy, thuggish features 
contrast with the fine cut of his suit, sits at a table with 
a woman in decolette. They laugh in an ugly way. 

BERNZY 
Never saw him. I'd take a stab in 
the dark he ain't Society League. 

On the desk blotter, Kay finds a legal paper, then comes 
back to the window. 

KAY 
He says he was my husband's partner. 

She hands him the pages. A vulgar, gilt embossed business 
card is clipped to the top page with a name -- EMILIO 
PORTIFINO -- and an East Side address. 

KAY 
He says Lou owed him money, and now 
he's my partner. 

BERNZY 
Never heard of him. 

KAY 
(disappointed) 
No?... 

Bernzy shakes his head. 

KAY 
Lou didn't need money -- 

BERNZY 
(examining the pages) 
'Offered as collateral in exchange 
for services rendered.' 

KAY 
-- and he didn't keep secrets from 
me. 

BERNZY 
How would you know? 

KAY 
Hm? 

BERNZY 
I mean if they're secrets. 

He smiles. 

KAY 
You know how it is -- when you're 
intimate with someone. 

Bernzy's smile freezes; he doesn't know. 

BERNZY 
Yeah, right. 

KAY 
I know Lou bootlegged in the old 
days. Who didn't? And I know every 
booking agent who comes in here isn't 
strictly on the up and up. But Lou 
was a reputable businessman. 

BERNZY 
This is his signature? 

She nods. She looks out the window, again, at Portifino. 

KAY 
He's here every night, not ten feet 
from the Governor or Walter Winchell. 

BERNZY 
Couldn't you just -- ? 

KAY 
Throw him out? I want to. But he 
says he'll go to my brother-in-law, 
and help him prove Lou's will is 
invalid. 

BERNZY 
Is it? 

KAY 
No! but -- I'm a second wife, there 
aren't any women in this business, 
and we both know what people say 
about me. I can't take the chance. 

As she looks out the window, staring at Portifino, she bites 
her lip, fretfully -- nothing like the cool elegant hostess 
she was on the floor of the club. This unnerves Bernzy. If 
she's just acting (vulnerable) she's doing a good job. 

BERNZY 
(clearing his throat) 
I could find out who he is. 

She takes his hand in hers. 

KAY 
Please. 

He looks at his hand in hers. Either feeling that she is 
being over-emotional, or sensing he is uncomfortable being 
touched, she lets go of him, grows more matter-of-fact. 

KAY 
I really don't know what's 
appropriate, but I'd like to pay you 
someth -- 

BERNZY 
No. 

KAY 
I just thought -- 

He shakes his head. A beat. 

BERNZY 
Danny, downstairs, 'suggested' I 
come in through the back. 

Looking at Bernzy, she can understand why the Doorman 
insisted: anybody could. 

KAY 
I'm sorry. I'll talk to him about 
it... 

He nods. This doesn't seem like quite enough. 

KAY 
Why don't you stay and have dinner? 

She indicates the club, below. 

BERNZY 
It's alright. 
(he smiles, starts to 
exit) 
It ain't that big a favor. 

KAY 
Next time, then. 

BERNZY 
(as he goes out) 
Yeah, right.

CAFE SOCIETY - MAIN FLOOR - LATER 

Bernzy, rather amazed, wearing a half-smile, stands waiting 
for his camera at the hat-check, looking out over the club. 
He looks up to the office window where Kay stands, looking 
down, smoking unhappily. 

Bernzy's smile fades: he's enjoying this too much.

INT. BERNZY'S APT - AFTERNOON 

In the bathroom, Bernzy is knotting a necktie, quickly but 
poorly. The bathroom is also the kitchen: it has a hotplate 
and a shelf of canned soup, canned chile, canned spaghetti. 
The tiny 

KITCHEN 

which Bernzy passes on his way out, has been turned into a 
darkroom. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BERNZY'S - DAY 

Bernzy hurries up the street, fidgeting with his tie. 

He is greeted by TOM HAYWARD, 30, a man in a seersucker suit 
with a wry manner and an Ivy League air. He holds a furled 
newspaper under his arm. 

HAYWARD 
Bernzy! Just coming to see you. 

BERNZY 
I'm late. Walk with me. 

HAYWARD 
What's with the tie? Somebody die? 

BERNZY 
Not yet. 

Hayward unfurls the newspaper, a Daily Mirror. The banner 
headline (no photo) reads: KILL MOTHER IN JERSEY WITH AX. 

HAYWARD 
Seen this? 

BERNZY 
Your work? 

HAYWARD 
Came off the wires. Couple of 
seventeen-year-old kids in Greenport, 
New Jersey. They're screwing in the 
girl's mother's kitchen, when who 
should walk in but mom. She starts 
screaming her head off and -- 

BERNZY 
Yeah, yeah: everybody already guessed 
what comes next. 

HAYWARD 
The local police won't let anybody 
near 'em: no pictures, no interviews. 

BERNZY 
I don't leave New York. 

They approach Bernzy's parking garage. A long line of cars 
extends out into the street, waiting to enter. But Bernzy 
and Hayward take no notice of it; it's business as usual. 

INT. GARAGE - SAME 

Now we see that the cars are queuing for gasoline. In the 
filling station of the garage's ground floor, a posted sign 
reads: 

HAVE YOUR GAS RATION COUPONS READY 

(No Coupons, No Gas) 

HAYWARD 
It's half an hour, over the bridge. 
(hurrying to keep up) 
There's gotta be 30 bucks in this 
for each of us if the wires pick it 
up. You telling me this thing's paid 
for already? 

He drags a finger through the dust atop Bernzy's sedan. 

As Bernzy thinks about it, Hayward pulls a silver whisky 
flask from his jacket, unstops it, drinks. 

BERNZY 
Alright. Call Greenport. Find out 
when the D.A.'s in court. Find out 
when the arresting officer's in the 
station house. In a two-bit town 
like this, he might even work the 
desk. When the cop's in and the D.A.'s 
out, gimme a call. 

HAYWARD 
Thanks, Bernzy. 

Bernzy gets into the car. 

HAYWARD 
Tell me where you're going dressed 
like that. 

Bernzy pulls the door shut without answering. 

CUT TO: 

INT. EASTSIDE OFFICE BLDG. - UPPER FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY 

In a panelled hallway, Bernzy reads the name on an oak door 
as he adjusts his tie. He goes in; we read the name on the 
door: 

H.R. RINEMAN & SONS, PUBLISHERS 

INT. ANTEROOM - RINEMAN PUBLISHING - SAME 

Bernzy gives his name to a RECEPTIONIST. 

RECEPTIONIST 
Is it a pick-up or a delivery? 

BERNZY 
(put out) 
I have an appointment. 

The door to the inner offices and a sympathetic bespectacled 
young man of 24, RICHARD RINEMAN, comes out, pulling into a 
coat. 

Bernzy approaches him, smiling. 

YOUNG RINEMAN 
(flustered) 
Mr. Bernstein. How are you. It's my 
father who'll see you today. I've a 
doctor's appointment, I'm afraid. 

Bernzy already suspects something is amiss, but hides it. 

BERNZY 
Sure, that's all right. 

YOUNG RINEMAN 
(smiling awkwardly) 
Well, then -- goodbye. 

He goes out. Bernzy seems to know the same door is going to 
open again. 

It does. H.R. RINEMAN appears, an athletically vigorous 60 
year old. 

RINEMAN 
Mr. Bernstein? 

INT. RINEMAN'S OFFICE - LATER 

Rineman leads Bernzy into his book-lined office: all dark 
wood and rich leather. 

RINEMAN 
Now does one call you Mr. Bernstein 
or Mr. Bernzini? Or is it just 
Bernzini? 

BERNZY 
I was born Leon Bernstein. But I got 
the name 'The Great Bernzini' from 
the gals at World-wide, the big photo 
agency? They said I had t'be a 
magician to get to so many disasters 
so fast. 

RINEMAN 
That's marvelous. 

He shows Bernzy to a chair in front of his desk, speaking as 
he takes his own seat, behind it. 

RINEMAN 
I know my son spoke to you 
optimistically about publishing your 
book. That's why he wanted me -- why 
I wanted to speak to you rather than 
tossing it back into the mail. 

Bernzy's eyes narrow almost imperceptibly but with a kind of 
anger: he's suffered this particular humiliation before. 

Bernzy's book is on Rineman's desk. It's a "dummy book" -- a 
manuscript made up of stiff pieces of paper onto which 
photographs, printed on good paper, have been glued, along 
with captions. 

The book lies open to a photograph of a black man with an 
agonized expression, a fire-truck behind him, his face lighted 
by the unseen flames of his tenement afire. 

RINEMAN 
Of course, from a technical point of 
view, this is fine work, fine work. 
It's simply that we don't publish 
books of this type. 

BERNZY 
Listen, Mr. Rineman, please don't 
hand me that -- please -- 'cause 
everybody knows Rineman & Sons 
publishes more photograph books than 
anybody else. 

RINEMAN 
(ever gracious) 
Well, sir, we publish books of 
photography. And to my mind, this is 
instead a most admirable picture 
book about New York. Not an inferior 
genre, just different. 

BERNZY 
No. You're wrong. This is a book of 
photography. 

RINEMAN 
If I may explain -- 

BERNZY 
I know what you mean. Still lifes, 
naked women gettin' out of bath-tubs, 
fruit on a plate -- it's a photo, 
but let's pretend it's a painting. 

We now see a row of tasteful framed photos on the wall behind 
Rineman, in precisely the style Bernzy describes. They include 
a woman getting out of her bath and fruit on a plate. 

BERNZY 
I know how to do that, too. I really 
do. But let's face it, you publish 
enough of them books already. 
Everybody does. C'mon, Mr. Rineman: 
show those other guys. This is the 
book. 

Bernzy winks. 

Rineman is appalled by Bernzy's boastfulness, but hides it. 

RINEMAN 
May I say you're not being fair to 
the photographers we do publish -- 
Dick Arlen, Harold Briley, Val 
Armbruster. 

BERNZY 
I'm sure they're nice guys, but those 
arty-farty shots are easy to get 
compared to something like this 
(he leans over, points 
to the open book, 
feature by feature) 
-- where you got a big shiny fire 
truck in front of you, and a whole 
building on fire behind you, so the 
light's every which way, and mean- 
time, this poor son-of-a-bitch is 
watching his life go up -- 

RINEMAN 
Really, I don't doubt the difficulties 
you must've faced... You're 
technically superb. 

BERNZY 
Right. 

RINEMAN 
(hiding his distaste 
again) 
But what I see here is a batch of 
pictures that's too -- sensational 
and too -- vulgar to justify printing 
a fine book of photography, which is 
an expensive thing to do. 

BERNZY 
What's vulgar, exactly? This guy? or 
the fire? 

RINEMAN 
Since you obviously have great talent, 
I'd like to suggest that you apply 
it to a subject matter that -- 

BERNZY 
No -- huh-nh, no. 

RINEMAN 
(finally letting his 
impatience show) 
Please listen, Mr. Bernstein -- ! 

BERNZY 
Don't you think I heard this advice 
before? I just happen to be right 
about all this, see? Don't you think 
I'd rather be shooting flowers or 
beautiful dames than campin' out 
with corpses? 

RINEMAN 
Maybe you should ask yourself. 
Sensationalism has its allure. It's 
potent. It can desensitize a man to 
the beauty of flowers -- or women. 

BERNZY 
What're you, a shrink? 

RINEMAN 
Hardly. But the men who do what you 
do don't usually feel the need to 
rationalize it like you -- much less 
be celebrated for it. 

BERNZY 
Nobody does what I do. 

Bernzy takes up the book as Rineman watches. 

He moves to the door, seizes the knob, but pauses. 

BERNZY 
I figure your boy really did wanna 
publish my book. Tell him I won't 
hold this against him when I have my 
big retrospective over at the modern 
art museum. 

RINEMAN 
(his interest piqued, 
now) 
You're having a show at the Museum 
of Modern Art? 

BERNZY 
Someday. 

RINEMAN 
(a thin smile) 
Oh... 
(his certitude restored) 
If you really disdain the publishing 
establishment so, why do you crave 
its acceptance? 

BERNZY 
Who the hell else is gonna publish a 
book? 

He slams the door behind him. 

CUT TO: 

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 

A door opens and a dozen flashbulbs blaze as a young HOOD, 
handcuffed to a Cop, enters the room. 

However, the Hood is covering his face with his unchained 
hand, so nobody gets a shot. Several Photographers, Bernzy 
not among them, are clustered at the door. 

PHOTOGRAPHER 1 
Give us a shot, son! 

COP 
Clear the way! 

PHOTOGRAPHER 2 
C'mon, one picture! 

The Hood, his face still shielded, kicks blindly in front of 
him, clearing the way. He is led toward the booking post. 

BERNZY, meantime, is perched on a Sergeant's desk, as the 
Sergeant reads over a file. Bernzy watches the commotion 
with the young Hood with interest but no urgency. 

SERGEANT 
There's two guys called Portifino 
with records. But nobody that age or 
description. 

BERNZY 
No record. 

SERGEANT 
Not in New York, anyway. 

BERNZY 
(baffled) 
Hm. Maybe he is Society League. 

As Bernzy gets up, he gives a few cigars to the Sergeant. 

BERNZY 
I gotta go take this kid's picture. 

The Sergeant scoops the cigars into his desk drawer. He looks 
over at the snarling, defiant Hood. 

SERGEANT 
I don't think he wants it took. 

BERNZY 
(taking up his camera) 
Everybody likes to have his picture 
took. 

Bernzy approaches the Hood, whose handcuffs have been removed 
so that he may be fingerprinted. He still covers his face. 

BERNZY 
Listen, kid. 

HOOD 
Fuck off. 

COP 
(to the Hood) 
Can you write? 

The Hood nods. 

COP 
Sign this. 

The Hood takes the pen and signs the form, still careful to 
keep his face concealed. 

BERNZY 
You ever heard of The Great Bernzini? 
I shot Dutch Schultz, Legs Diamond -- 
these guys never covered their face 
from me. 

HOOD 
I said fuck off. 

BERNZY 
I get everybody's picture, while 
he's alive or after... I ain't met 
the guy yet looks better after. 

HOOD 
(after a beat) 
You that freak, drives around in a 
sedan all night? 

BERNZY 
That's me. 

HOOD 
I heard about you. 

BERNZY 
In your line of work, I'm the 
photographer to the stars. 

HOOD 
Yeah, yeah, I heard of you. Them 
other creeps around? 

Bernzy looks over to make sure the other Photographers have 
given up. 

BERNZY 
They're over there, smoking. 

The Hood uncovers his face. The police have worked him over. 
He has a mean cut under one eye. He gives Bernzy his fiercest, 
most defiant post. 

Bernzy squeezes the shutter. 

When the flash fires, all the other Photographers look over 
quickly. 

But the Hood has covered his face, again. 

BERNZY 
Thanks. 

HOOD 
Fuck off. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. EAST SIDE - NIGHT 

In his parked car, Bernzy reads Portifino's gilt business 
card under the dashboard light, then looks out at Portifino's 
residence: 

A high-priced building with a Moderne facade and a Doorman. 

Bernzy gets out, tosses his cigar away, stows his camera in 
the trunk, crosses and enters. 

INT. BUILDING LOBBY - SAME 

We watch from outside the glass as Bernzy speaks to the 
Doorman, bribes him, is directed to the elevator. 

INT. HALLWAY - SAME 

Bernzy comes off the elevator, heads down the hallway to APT 
7G. The door is barely ajar; a sliver of light falls through 
the crack, onto the hallway carpet. 

Bernzy rings the bell. No response. He rings again. Waiting 
he glances downward casually -- 

BERNZY 
Whoops. 

A shimmering dark ribbon of blood seeps under the doorway. 

Bernzy pushes the door open a few inches before it hits 
something solid. He forces the door another few inches, and 
pulls himself through the opening. 

INT. PORTIFINO'S APT. - SAME 

The luxury apartment has a few pieces of furniture and some 
unopened boxes in it; Portifino has just moved in. 

But it is Porfitino who lies dead by the door. 

He is tangled in piano wire. The wire was rigged around the 
still-living Portifino so that any movement caused it to dig 
more deeply into him. He killed himself by dragging himself 
to the door to seek help. 

Bernzy goes to the telephone, dials a number. 

VOICE (O.S.) 
Precinct. 

BERNZY 
Homicide, please. 

beat. Then a voice: 

CONKLIN (O.S.) 
Homicide. Conklin. 

BERNZY 
Hey, Conklin, it's Bernzy. 

CONKLIN (O.S.) 
What's up, Bernzy? 

BERNZY 
I was paying kind of a social call 
on a guy called Emilio Portifino. 

There is an odd silence on Conklin's end -- and then an edge 
to his voice. 

CONKLIN (O.S.) 
Yes? 

BERNZY 
The guy's been murdered. I'm standin' 
here in his apartment now. 
(he glances at the 
corpse) 
Professional job. I never saw anything 
like it. 

CONKLIN (O.S.) 
Alright, stay where you are. 

BERNZY 
I gotta leave for a few minutes. 

CONKLIN (O.S.) 
What? 

BERNZY 
Just downstairs, to get my camera. 
(he looks at the corpse) 
This is somethin' you don't see alot. 

CONKLIN (O.S.) 
No. Stay put! We'll be there in five 
minutes. 

BERNZY 
Alright. The address is one-fifteen -- 

But the phone clicks off. Bernzy sets down the receiver. He 
looks at the corpse. 

BERNZY 
He knew your address already. 

He picks up the phone, dials another number. 

BERNZY 
Kay Levitz, please... 

PHONE VOICE (O.S.) 
Who's calling? 

BERNZY 
Leon Bernstein -- Bernzy. 

INTERCUT TO: 

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT 

A Waiter plugs in a telephone by a table where Kay chats and 
laughs with some Society Types. He hands her the telephone. 

INTERCUT TO: 

INT. PORTIFINO'S APT. 

Bernzy looks at the corpse as he speaks on the phone. 

BERNZY 
You're not gonna have no more trouble 
with Portifino in the good seats. 

INT. CAFE SOCIETY 

Kay is stunned as the other people at the table laugh gayly, 
obliviously, around her. 

KAY 
He's was what?... My God. 

Hearing her, one of the Men at the table looks at her. She 
forces a smile. 

INT. PORTIFINO'S APT. 

Bernzy looks at his watch. 

BERNZY 
Anything you better tell me? Anything 
I better know before the cops get 
here? 

INT. CAFE SOCIETY 

At the table, the Man smiles at Kay, again. She smiles back 
only fleetingly, before shifting in her seat, so she can 
speak more privately into the phone. 

KAY 
Bernzy, all I know about him is what 
I told you. If you're asking what I 
think you are -- 

BERNZY (O.S.) 
I'm not askin' that... 

INT. PORTIFINO'S APT. 

BERNZY 
The Mob did this guy in, it's obvious. 

INT. CAFE SOCIETY 

KAY 
(weak, as if from a 
blow) 
The Mob. 

INT. PORTIFINO'S APARTMENT 

Bernzy can hear how upset she is. He wants to say something 
comforting, but he wants to get his picture. He looks at 
Portifino. 

BERNZY 
Yeah. Alright, look, I -- I'll be in 
touch. I gotta go. 

CUT TO: 

INT. PORTIFINO'S BLDG. - 7TH FLR HALLWAY - LATER 

CONKLIN, in a suit, comes swiftly off the elevator, with two 
Uniformed Cops and a Man in a gray suit and hat behind him. 

INT. PORTIFINO'S APT. - SAME 

Bernzy, having ignored Conklin's request, stands over the 
corpse, taking a picture. He smokes a cigar. 

Conklin and the others burst in. Conklin leads the man in 
the suit to Bernzy as the others set to work, dusting for 
finger-prints, etc. 

BERNZY 
(taking another picture) 
Conklin. 

CONKLIN 
(to the man in the 
suit) 
Mr. Chadwick, this is Leon Bernstein, 
commonly known as The Great Bernzini. 
Bernzy, this is Inspector Chadwick 
of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. 

Surprised, Bernzy looks over from his viewfinder. 

BERNZY 
Pleased to meet you. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. FEDERAL BLDG. (CHURCH ST.) - NIGHT 

Low angle: Tires squeal as an unmarked sedan pulls up to the 
curb. 

Bernzy is quickly and closely escorted from the car, up the 
stairs, like a star witness or a criminal in custody. He 
raises his eyebrows wryly, wonders what the hell is going 
on... 

CUT TO: 

INT. FBI - CHADWICK'S OFFICE - LATER 

Bernzy is in front of the desk in Chadwick's clean, non- 
descript office. One one side of him, a Young Agent takes 
notes; on the other side of him an Older Agent (gray-haired) 
says nothing, merely observes. 

Chadwick stands behind his desk, in front of two steel filing 
cabinets. He interrogates Bernzy in the humorless G-Man style. 

CHADWICK 
What was your business with Portifino? 

BERNZY 
I told you. I was just calling on 
him as a favor to a friend. 

CHADWICK 
Right. What did you say your friend's 
name was? 

BERNZY 
I didn't say. 

Chadwick waits a beat: Bernzy offers nothing. 

BERNZY 
What're you investigating here, 
anyway? I mean, what was this guy -- 

CHADWICK 
Did your friend have business dealings 
with Portifino. 

BERNZY 
No. 

CHADWICK 
Detective Conklin tells us you know 
many members of the mob in New York. 

BERNZY 
I also know a lot of cops and wash- 
room attendants. It's the only way a 
photographer stays in business. I 
mean a tabloid photographer, not a 
Steiglitz or a Steichen. 

YOUNG AGENT 
(for his notes) 
Excuse me. Steigle or -- ? 

BERNZY 
The second and third best 
photographers in the country. 

Nobody asks who's first. 

CHADWICK 
Don't mobsters sometimes say they 
won't let anybody but you take their 
picture? 

BERNZY 
That's right. I'm sure you get t'know 
a lot of criminals in your line of 
work, too. 

Chadwick, impervious to humor, stares. 

BERNZY 
Maybe not. 

CHADWICK 
Was Portifino with the mob? 

BERNZY 
I dunno... Was he? 

CHADWICK 
I ask the questions here... How did 
he do it? How did he come to town 
and set himself up so fast? 

BERNZY 
Look, you know more about this guy 
than I do, that's obvious. I call 
Conklin, right away you guys know 
the address, now you're tellin' me 
he's in business -- 

Chadwick brings his fists down hard onto the desk, rattling 
the lamps, ashtray and desk-set. 

CHADWICK 
Tell us how Portifino made his money! 

BERNZY 
I don't know anything. I see the guy 
once for five seconds, next time I 
see him he's dead. 
(he looks around) 
I have to get to work now. 

CHADWICK 
Oh? You have a job? 

BERNZY 
(wearily, patiently) 
I'm a free-lance photographer. If 
I'm not on the street at midnight, 
the world passes me by. 

CHADWICK 
Tough way to make a living... You 
were hoping to get money from 
Portifino, is that right? 

BERNZY 
What? 

CHADWICK 
You intended to blackmail him. 

BERNZY 
This is a joke. 
(he looks to the others) 
It's a gag, right? 

CHADWICK 
Mr. Bernstein, you came to this 
country from Russia when you were 
six years old. 

BERNZY 
(getting up, putting 
on his hat) 
Alright, that's it. I got my cell 
meeting in half an hour. 

He reaches for his exposed film plates on the desk. But 
Chadwick traps his hand there. 

CHADWICK 
Where you going? How d'you know you're 
not a suspect in the murder of Emilio 
Portifino? 

BERNZY 
This is the stupidest interrogation 
I've ever seen. You're telling me 
more than I'm telling you. Already I 
know this guy got rich quick doing 
something the Feds don't like. Already 
I can see you're tryin' to keep it 
quiet, and when you bring up Russia, 
I figure it's something treasonous. 

Chadwick begins to speak, but the Older Agent -- alarmed by 
Bernzy's perspicacity -- takes over. 

OLDER AGENT 
Mr. Bernstein, thanks for your 
cooperation. We're sorry if we've 
taken you away from your work. This 
is a time of war, and we hope you'll 
keep your conjectures about Mr. 
Portifino to yourself. Fact is, we 
know nothing about the man, and hoped 
perhaps you did. 

Bernzy doesn't believe the last part, but keeps it to himself. 

BERNZY 
Yeah, okay. So if I could just get 
my film plates back... 

OLDER AGENT 
We can't give them to you. Not for a 
few days. 

BERNZY 
He's news tonight. I won't be able 
to sell 'em in a few days. 

OLDER AGENT 
Stop back here at Inspector Chadwick's 
office in the morning. He'll give 
you the proper forms to fill in. 

Bernzy looks from face to face, seeing he has no choice in 
the matter. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - NIGHT 

Bernzy comes down the stairs of the F.B.I. building and begins 
walking, camera in hand. 

Across the street, a car starts up as Bernzy heads up the 
block. It begins to follow him, keeping a discreet distance. 

Bernzy turns off the avenue, onto the sidestreet. The car 
makes the turn too. 

EXT. SIDESTREET 

As Bernzy moves along the dark sidewalk, he realizes the car 
is following him. He picks up his pace, but the car follows 
suit. Almost reflexively he begins to load a film plate into 
his camera, but the car accelerates, and overtakes him on 
the sidewalk. Two MEN get out -- thick-featured and thuggish -- 
while a third Man stays behind the wheel. 

The Men close in around Bernzy. Each takes one of his arms. 
The camera falls to the ground; the lens shatters. They drag 
Bernzy gruffly into the car. 

BERNZY 
You boys work for Farinelli, right? 
(recognizing one of 
them) 
It's Tonio, right? 

Bernzy's attempt at affability is futile: grimly serious, 
they push him into the car. 

BERNZY 
(as he's stuffed into 
the seat) 
At least pick up the damn camera! 

CUT TO: 

EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

The same car pulls up and parks. 

As one of the Thugs pulls Bernzy out, Bernzy reaches back to 
pick up his smashed camera. 

CUT TO: 

INT. FARINELLI'S OFFICE - NIGHT 

The panelled office might belong to a well-off insurance 
agent with a weakness for ugly nick-nacks. 

Farinelli rises to his feet as Bernzy is pushed into the 
room. He is an overweight, mid-level capo of 55. Two of his 
lieutenants are sitting on a couch. 

FARINELLI 
(to his goons) 
What're you pushin' him around for? 
We know this guy. 
(he shakes his head) 
Have a seat, Bernzy. Want a drink? 

BERNZY 
You got coffee? 

He gestures to one of the Hoods to fetch coffee. 

FARINELLI 
You know Mikey and Sal? 

The two lieutenants nod from the couch. SAL is lean, with a 
particularly arresting face (we will see him again). 

LIEUTENANTS 
Hiya, Bernzy/Bernzy. 

FARINELLI 
Bernzy, you found the body of this 
punk Portifino, right? 

Bernzy nods. 

FARINELLI 
So what d'you know about him? 

BERNZY 
Nothing, really. 

FARINELLI 
'Nothin.' Then why'd you call the 
Feds? 

BERNZY 
I didn't. 

FARINELLI 
You didn't. 

BERNZY 
I found the body. Not the first I 
ever found. I called the cops, like 
I always do. They called the F.B.I. 

Annoyed, Farinelli turns to his lieutenants, speaks in 
Italian. After a brief tirade, he turns back to Bernzy. 

FARINELLI 
Okay, so you didn't call the Feds, 
we was misinformed by a police stooge. 
I'd still like to know how you knew 
Portifino. 

BERNZY 
I didn't. Not really. 

The Hood returns with coffee from someplace outside. But 
Farinelli, annoyed by now, directs him to put it on a side 
table (instead of giving it to Bernzy). 

FARINELLI 
You didn't, not really... Then what 
were you doin' in his apartment, if 
I may ask? 

Bernzy studies Farinelli a beat before answering. He can see 
how agitated Farinelli is about all of this. 

BERNZY 
I met him the other night. At Cafe 
Society. He said he needed somebody 
to take his picture. He offered good 
money. 

FARINELLI 
You don't do commissions. I offered 
you plenty when my sister's boy took 
communion two years ago. 

Close on Bernzy, caught in a lie. 

BERNZY 
That's right, I don't. Do commissions. 
But I got a nose for news. Talkin' 
to this kid, it smelled like there 
might be somethin' in it. 

FARINELLI 
(getting up) 
Oh! So that's all there is to it? 

Bernzy nods; he watches as Farinelli moves next to his seat, 
looms over him, smiling. But his face turns fierce as 
Farinelli kicks the chair out from under Bernzy, who flops 
onto his back and hits his head on the tiles. 

Bernzy lies on the floor, more stunned and humiliated than 
hurt, and looks up at the half-circle formed around him by 
Farinelli and his thugs. 

Bernzy stares up at Farinelli. He raises his right hand to 
God. 

After a long beat, Farinelli extends his hand, to help him 
up. 

FARINELLI 
Okay, Bernzy. As it is, I gotta trust 
you. You never crossed nobody, got 
no interest in dough, do nothin' but 
take pictures, noon and night. 

He circles his arm around Bernzy, and walks him to the door. 

FARINELLI 
What is it with you, anyway? Dope 
fiends live better than you do. You're 
a fuckin' freak, you know that? 

BERNZY 
Yeah, well, like the guy who shoveled 
the elephant shit said to the circus 
owner, 'What? And give up Show 
Business?'. 

Farinelli laughs but grips Bernzy a little too tightly. 

FARINELLI 
Don't go around talkin' about this 
dead little fuck, awright? 

We begin to hear lively music play, anticipating the 

CUT TO: 

EXT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT 

The usual crowd is gathered by the ropes. The other 
Photographers watch sullenly as the rope is raised for Bernzy. 

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - SAME 

Bernzy is looking upward, toward the windowed office as he 
crosses the club. He is therefore taken unawares when a Man 
at a good table catches him by the sleeve -- 

MAN 
Surprised they let you in here, 
Bernstein. I'll complain to the 
management. 

Bernzy sees ARTHUR NABLER, a likable man, 57-years-old, 
overweight, seemingly unaccustomed to the dinner clothes 
he's wearing. At the moment, he's drunk. 

A Woman is with him at the table, much younger than he is, 
attractive in flashy way. 

NABLER 
Siddown, c'mon, sit! 

Bernzy glances up at the office again -- 

BERNZY 
Half a minute. 

NABLER 
Don't be a pill! How else you ever 
gonna sit right here... 'Hack makes 
good,' eh Bernzy? Meet Vera Hixon. 
Vera, this guy's the best shutterbug 
in New York. 
(to Bernzy) 
You seen my show? 

BERNZY 
It's on my calendar. 'Brooklyn 
Rhapsody,' Winter Garden Theatre. 
But I work nights. 

VERA 
It's a beautiful show. 

She squeezes Nabler's arm in her hands and rubs her cheek 
against his shoulder. 

NABLER 
I know what you think: why should I 
go see a bunch of Arty's old columns 
dramatized when I already read 'em. 

Nabler drains his Scotch. 

BERNZY 
Untrue... I never read 'em. 

But Nabler's mood is turning sour as his high winds down. He 
can't seem to find a Waiter to bring him a new Scotch. 

NABLER 
Waiter! 
(getting no response) 
I'm dyin' here... I'm 57 years old. 
You think she'd've looked at me six 
months ago? 

BERNZY 
C'mon, Nabler. 

NABLER 
Best shutterbug in New York. You 
know what that means? It means his 
pictures are catching birdshit at 
the bottom of the cage six hours 
after the papers come out. Just like 
my columns used to do. 

Nabler tries to attract the Waiter, again, but seeing what's 
happening, Vera tries to ease the glass out of his hand. 

VERA 
Arty -- ? 

He pulls the glass away from her. 

NABLER 
At least if you write books or paint 
pictures they say, Alright, he had 
no money, no life, not even a steady 
girl, but look what he painted, look 
what he wrote. (he answers his own 
question) She wouldn't of pissed on 
me, six months ago. 

VERA 
(rising, upset) 
Excuse me -- 

BERNZY 
(half rising, politely) 
Miss Hixon. 
(to Nabler, when she's 
gone) 
Arthur, I think you better apologize 
to the lady. 

Bernzy gets up, but Nabler grabs his hand. 

NABLER 
You're giving me advice about my 
love life?! 

Eager to escape, Bernzy tries to wrest his hand away. But 
Nabler clings to it: he's as deadly earnest as a dying man. 

NABLER 
Listen to me, Bernzy, listen to one 
who knows: Nobody could love you. No 
woman could ever love a shabby little 
guy who sleeps in his clothes and 
eats outta cans and cozies up to 
corpses so much he starts to stink 
like one. 

Bernzy, sucker-punched, attempts to remove his hand. 

BERNZY 
Arty, you better get a refund from 
that charm school -- 

NABLER 
(he won't relinquish 
Bernzy's hand) 
And for what? Drunks and stiffs -- 

BERNZY 
Y'mind? -- I got a bird in the oven -- 

Bernzy pulls his hand away, but Nabler is not in control, 
blubbering and shouting, melancholy and drunk. 

NABLER 
-- thugs and bums and whores and 
creeps -- 

He draws attention: it sounds like he's shouting epithets. 

We move with Bernzy, who is stoical and swift, past the 
glittering crowd. Nabler is blubbering and shouting under 
the music but Bernzy isn't hearing him. 

We see what he sees, but this time it's in color -- it's 
life, untransmogrified: 

Men and women laughing, drinking champagne, eating steaks, 
hands held across tables, words whispered into lovers' ears, 
the music smooth and gay. The music rises. 

CUT TO: 

INT. KAY'S OFFICE - LATER 

It's suddenly quiet. The band is on its break. 

Bernzy staring out the window, sees into the club where Nabler 
is trying to get Vera to sit down with him again, but she 
pulls away, stalks out. 

KAY 
You should know I got worried. I 
called the police -- two hours ago. 

He looks at her -- annoyed. 

BERNZY 
What'd y'do that for? 

Obviously, she meant well. He softens. 

BERNZY 
Look, I -- I don't do favors f'r 
people, I can't. Y'see what happens? 
I walk in here with an invitation, 
you give me a drink, it's beautiful 
up here, I'm feelin' good about myself -- 
next thing I know I'm rollin' around 
on some gangster's floor. 

They look at each other. 

KAY 
I'm sorry. 

BERNZY 
Yeah... 

She goes to get a cigarette by the desk. He looks down into 
the club, sees Nabler, then asks -- 

BERNZY 
Why'd you ask me up here in the first 
place? 

KAY 
...Lou trusted you, Bernzy. I told 
you, he -- 

BERNZY 
C'mon. Lou thought I was just like 
the flies outside, buzzin' around to 
get Rita Hayworth's picture -- 

KAY 
It's not true. 

BERNZY 
-- A little parasite, preyin' on 
people's misery. You're not the only 
one knows what people say about you... 

KAY 
It doesn't matter what they say about 
you, Bernzy. Not unless you believe 
'em. 

He looks at her. Her words seem to get to him, or maybe just 
she does. 

He looks away, down into the club again. He watches NABLER, 
as struggles to his feet, throws money on the table, and 
staggers away. 

BERNZY 
It's not over because Portifino's 
dead. Somebody else is gonna come in 
and tell you he's Lou's partner. 

By the desk, holding a cigarette, she speaks quietly. 

KAY 
I figured. 

She takes a seat on the desk, as if for support. 

BERNZY 
I think Lou was involved in somethin' 
bad... Evil. 

She nods, determined to be strong, determined not to be 
emotional, although she knows she's in trouble. 

He looks back into the window. 

BERNZY 
I could prob'ly find out what it is. 
I could do that. 

He sees her reflection in the window. She stares off 
somewhere, trying not to cry. 

KAY 
(quietly) 
You don't have to. 

Bernzy is staring at her reflection. He sees himself, too: 
the ill-fitting suit, the ludicrous pockets. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. EASTSIDE DRIVE - NIGHT 

In black and white, we see a stretch of walkway by the East 
River, thick with couples who stroll and kiss. 

Bernzy drives by slowly, watches keenly, afflicted by the 
strong feelings Kay has stirred up in him. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. FEDERAL BLDG. - CHURCH STREET - DAWN 

The building to which Bernzy was brought for interrogation. 

INT. FEDERAL BLDG. - LOBBY - SAME 

In the overscaled marble lobby, Bernzy pleads his case to a 
uniformed Watchman. 

BERNZY 
He's gone? He promised he'd give me 
back my plates this morning. 

WATCHMAN 
Then why don't you come back when it 
really is morning? 

BERNZY 
It's morning at the Daily Mirror. 
It's morning at the Post. I gotta 
make a living, just like you. 

WATCHMAN 
Sit over there while I phone somebody. 

The Watchman gestures to a marble bench by the elevator 
alcove. 

He himself goes to the marble reception desk, to make the 
call. 

As the guard dials, Bernzy walks straight past the bench, 
into the elevator. The doors close behind him. 

CUT TO: 

INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY (FBI) - SAME 

Bernzy comes off the elevator, onto a long hall with offices 
on either side. Some doors are open; we can hear the vacuum 
cleaner of a janitor. 

Bernzy comes quickly down to the hallway, to the office at 
the head of it -- Chadwick's. A pail and mop stand outside, 
but when Bernzy peeks into the open door, the office is empty. 
He enters. 

INT. CHADWICK'S OFFICE 

Bernzy hurries behind the desk, to a steel filing cabinet, 
one of two. It is locked. He studies the lock. His only light 
comes from the hallway, through the frosted glass. He jiggles 
the lock. It won't budge. He searches for the key in the 
desk drawers. Can't find it. 

He looks at the other filing cabinet. It has no lock, but is 
marked "UNCLASSIFIED MATERIAL." This seems less than promising 
but Bernzy unrolls the top drawer, anyway. 

He takes out his cigarette lighter, strikes the flame. It 
throws a wavering flame over the file tabs. He finds the one 
he WANTS: "PORTIFINO, EMILIO." 

INTERCUT TO: 

INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - LOBBY - SAME 

Chadwick charges in. 

CHADWICK 
Where is he? 

The Watchman, who by now has two other Uniformed Guards with 
him, points to the clock-style indicator on one of the 
elevators: 4TH FLOOR. 

They all get into the available elevator. 

INTERCUT TO: 

INT. CHADWICK'S OFFICE 

Bernzy opens the file. We read it with him. The pages are 
attached to a manila folder from the top, like a medical 
file: 

PORTIFINO, EMILIO 

Deceased 6/3/42 

ALL FILES EXPUNGED, TRANSFERRED TO WASHINGTON, D.C. 6/3/42. 

BERNZY 
Damn. 

In frustration, he turns the page, to see if there's more. 
There is a second page, on which all the print is blacked 
out. A third page is likewise obliterated. 

INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY 

Chadwick and the three Guards come hurriedly off the elevator. 

INT. CHADWICK'S OFFICE 

As the footsteps of Chadwick et. al. echo down the hallway, 
Bernzy pages past several more blacked-out pages, before 
coming to the last page, on which a single sentence remains: 

SEE ALSO "CL(assified) FILE #42784 -- "BLACK GAS" 

The waving lighter flame excites a sense of evil as we come 
close to these sinister sounding words -- "BLACK GAS." 

Bernzy knits his brow -- but has no time to wonder: the 
silhouettes of Chadwick et. al. are on the frosted glass. 

As he digs into the file cabinet to re-insert the goods, we 
watch the silhouettes growing nearer and nearer on the glass. 

Bernzy rolls shut the drawer just as the door swings open, 
plops himself into Chadwick's chair, puts his feet on the 
desk (a more insolent, but less incriminating pose). 

CHADWICK 
What is this? 

BERNZY 
I'm not leaving till I get back my 
plates. 

Chadwick looks at Bernzy suspiciously. He plunges his hand 
into his pants pocket, extracts a ring of keys, moves swiftly 
to the locked file cabinet, opens it. 

He pulls out Bernzy's plates (in a pouch), spreads them on 
the desk, counts them. Then he puts them back in the pouch, 
back in the file, and locks it. 

He turns back to Bernzy, seething. 

WATCHMAN 
Should I call the cops, Inspector? 

Chadwick is thinking about it. 

CUT TO: 

INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAWN 

OPEN CLOSE on a poster which shows G.I. Joe -- his weary 
face smudged black with battle. The enemy advances from a 
distant hill. Joe stands beside his jeep with a gas can -- 
but only a last drop of fuel is left. 

"DO YOUR PART! SAVE A GALLON FOR G.I. JOE!" proclaims the 
poster's bold slogan. Then, in lesser letters: "Rationing 
Saves American Lives." 

Bernzy stands in his underground parking garage, studying 
the poster, his brow knitted. 

By the concrete wall beyond the pumps, a teenage grease-monkey 
reads a "Shadow" pulp on a folding chair. 

BERNZY 
You got any Black Gas, Freddy? 

FREDDY 
What kinda gas? 

BERNZY 
Black Gas. 
(guessing) 
Black -- I dunno -- black market 
gas. 

FREDDY 
(confused) 
Only gas we got here is Texaco. 

BERNZY 
(he sees it's futile) 
Thanks. 

FREDDY 
There's somebody was lookin' for 
you, Mr. Bernstein. 

BERNZY 
Oh yeah? 

CUT TO: 

INT. STAIRWELL - BERNZY'S APT. - SAME 

As Bernzy comes up the stairs he sees a man in a tweed sports- 
coat with leather arm patches hunched against his front door, 
reading the New York Times. He looks up from his paper when 
he hears Bernzy, comes to his feet, smiles pleasantly. 

BERNZY 
What're you doin' up at this hour? 
Like I don't know the answer. 

Bernzy is unlocking his door. AARON is his younger brother. 

INT. BERNZY'S APT - SAME 

Aaron is unfazed by the disarray of the apartment. 

BERNZY 
I'm not comin' with you. Coffee? 

Aaron has the same New York accent as his brother but uses 
the grammar of an educated man. 

AARON 
It's inconceivable to you I just 
came over for a little visit? 

Aaron examines the photographs on Bernzy's desk as Bernzy 
fixes coffee in the bathroom: he pours coffee grinds into a 
saucepan. 

BERNZY 
Yeah it is. 

AARON 
(he joins Bernzy) 
Just come sit with him for half an 
hour. 

Bernzy imitates the voice of an aged, immigrant Jew from the 
Lower East Side, via Russia, i.e., his father. 

BERNZY 
'Such a vaste, Leon. Vit' your 
beckground, it's a tregedy. Your 
bruther Aaron's a learned men, a 
professor, vit' a beautiful vife -- 
end you? you drife eround in a car 
all the night teking pornogrephic 
pictures, eating in drugstores all 
alone. Breaks my heart, Leon, it 
breaks en old men's heart.' 

He goes back to the coffee, uselessly stirring the grounds. 

AARON 
I don't know what to say. I spend my 
life defending you. But when it comes 
down to it, I don't know what the 
hell you're doing down here -- 

BERNZY 
See for yourself; it's no big secret. 

AARON 
Believe me, you look around this 
place it leaves you with a few 
questions. 

BERNZY 
What's that s'posed to mean? 

AARON 
Forget it... He's a professional 
immigrant. He's the ultimate outsider. 
But he's an amateur, compared to 
you. 

BERNZY 
Yeah? I wonder if you'd say that if 
you'd seen me at Cafe Society last 
night. I mean inside. 

Bernzy strains the coffee, and pours it. 

AARON 
Yeah? So who invited you? Lou Levitz? 

BERNZY 
He's dead, Professor... How would 
you know him, anyway. I thought guys 
like you didn't read the tabloids. 

He moves into the main room. Aaron follows. 

AARON 
I read the tabloids, Leon. I take an 
interest in my brother. I'm glad 
you're an insider now. What's that 
got to do with Pa, rotting on his 
ass down on Delancey Street? 

BERNZY 
Other people're startin' to take an 
interest in me, too, alright? When 
the time comes, when I get my book 
published, I'll go see Pa. 

AARON 
D'you really think your own father's 
opinion of you needs to be validated 
by a publishing house? 

BERNZY 
No less than anybody else's. 

They look at each other, as Bernzy hands him a mug of coffee. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - DAY 

The shades are drawn against the daylight. The police radio 
hisses at low volume. We find Bernzy, slumped asleep in his 
clothes, in a chair. On the armrest is one of his cigar box 
files marked "Prizefights." Around Bernzy there is a litter 
of photos of Kay with her husband, ringside. 

Bernzy holds a picture of Kay in his hand. He fell asleep 
holding it. 

The telephone rings, shrilly. Bernzy answers it, groggily. 

BERNZY 
'Lo? 
(he listens) 
Oh yeah? Right. 

He hangs up the phone. He looks at the picture in his hands -- 
then at the squalor around him -- then at Kay, again.

EXT. HAYWARD'S CAR/HIGHWAY - DAY 

Bernzy rides in the passenger seat of Hayward's sportster on 
the Palisades Parkway. Hayward drinks from his flask.

BERNZY 
We'll be finished by three.

EXT. GREENPORT, NEW JERSEY POLICE STATION - DAY 

Bernzy and Hayward climb the steps of the almost rustic police 
station. Bernzy has his camera. 

HAYWARD 
How you gonna do this? 

BERNZY 
Don't worry about it. Everybody likes 
to have his picture took. 

CUT TO: 

INT. GREENPORT POLICE STATION - SAME 

Bernzy is talking to the earnest, red-haired SERGEANT POINTER. 
Hayward stands in the background, watching. 

HAYWARD 
We had a whole crowd of boys in from 
New York last week. Nobody gets to 
see those kids. 

BERNZY 
I don't see how the kids matter, 
Sgt. Pointer. Do you? 

POINTER 
What're you talkin' about? 

BERNZY 
I don't see that it takes a whole 
lot of courage to hit an old lady 
with an ax. 

POINTER 
It's sick, is what it is. 

BERNZY 
That's what I'm sayin'. It's sick. 
But to walk into a house with some 
sick kid runnin' around with an ax -- 
that's courage. 

POINTER 
What're you gettin' at? 

BERNZY 
We'd like to meet that man arrested 
those kids. 

POINTER 
That'd be me. 

BERNZY 
("surprised") 
It was you? Then it's your picture I 
wanna take. My colleague, Mr. Hayward, 
would like to take down your words. 
What it was like. You've prob'ly 
seen our series in the Saturday 
Evening Post. 'Brave me in blue'? 

POINTER 
Yeah. Oh yeah. 

INT. SERGEANTS' OFFICE - LATER 

In an office with three desks, Bernzy has just taken a picture 
of Pointer in uniform. He is lining up another one. Pointer 
smiles -- pleased by the attention -- and swells his chest. 

Suddenly Bernzy breaks off in seeming exasperation. 

BERNZY 
No. No, this upsets me. This really 
upsets me. 

POINTER 
What's wrong? I do somethin' wrong? 

BERNZY 
You? No. You should be on the $50 
bill. It's just not gonna work. 

Bernzy smiles sadly, starts to pack up his camera; Pointer 
watches forlornly. 

POINTER 
Mr. Bernzini, I think you owe me an 
explanation. 

BERNZY 
(reluctantly) 
...Who said no pictures of those 
kids? It was the D.A., right? 

POINTER 
All of us agreed. 

BERNZY 
But it was the D.A. said it first. 

Pointer doesn't deny it. 

BERNZY 
You see what I'm saying? You ever 
caught a fish on vacation? 

Pointer nods. 

BERNZY 
You get a pictue of yourself after 
you caught him? 

POINTER 
Sure. 

BERNZY 
With the fish, or without him. 

POINTER 
No pictures of those kids. That's 
final. 

BERNZY 
And I'll tell you why, Sgt. Pointer. 
There'll be plenty of pictures of 
those kids when the D.A. gets his 
conviction. You caught the fish only 
he's in the picture. 
(turning to Hayward) 
Ready, Hayward. 

Pointer watches as they go out the door. 

POINTER

Wait!

one of him, too. I'll send it to his 
mother. 'Case I ever gotta drive 
through Greenport. 

Chuckling, Hayward sees a roadside filling station. 

HAYWARD 
I gotta stop in here. 

EXT. HAYWARD'S CAR/FILLING STATION - LATER 

An Attendant is filling the tank. 

Hayward takes a large sheet of gas rationing coupons from 
his billfold. 

Bernzy's eyes narrow. He knows the coupons are significant, 
but plays it cool. 

BERNZY 
How'd you get so many stamps? 

HAYWARD 
Guy at my garage sold me some extra. 

As Hayward pays the Station Attendant, Bernzy takes the 
stamps, examines them. 

BERNZY 
Extra? Where's he get extra? 

HAYWARD 
(drinking from his 
flask) 
I don't look a gift horse in the 
mouth. 

Bernzy continues to study the stamps as Hayward starts the 
car, moves toward the highway. 

HAYWARD 
What's so interesting about those 
stamps? 

BERNZY 
Let's go. 

As Hayward pulls out onto the highway, we hear a car horn 
scream as we 

SHOCK CUT TO: 

EXT. LOWER WEST SIDE - NIGHT 

The horn comes not from an oncoming car, but from a parked 
one: the head of a Man murdered while driving is pressed up 
against the steering wheel, causing the horn to blow 
ceaselessly. The front end of the car is wrapped around a 
pole. 

O'Brien, the cop we saw in the first scene leans into the 
car (parked in a deserted quarter, near the docks) and guides 
the dead man's head back onto the seat (his hat falls off). 
The horn stops. 

Beside O'Brien stands his partner, the Young Cop. There are 
bullet holes piercing the driver's door. The windshield is 
shattered. 

O'Brien swings around when he hears someone coming up behind 
him. 

O'BRIEN 
Jesus. 

It's Bernzy. He takes up his camera to get a wide shot -- 
the car in all it's devastation. 

BERNZY 
His hat fell off. 

O'BRIEN 
Huh? 

BERNZY 
Could you put it back on, please? 
People really like to see a dead 
guy's hat. 

O'Brien replaces the hat, begrudgingly, again. 

O'BRIEN 
Maybe I should pull his dick out. 
Maybe they'd like to see a dead guy's 
dick. 

BERNZY 
The News'd prob'ly buy it. 
(he squeezes the 
shutter) 
I might have some trouble over at 
the Mirror. 

O'BRIEN 
(of the corpse) 
Who'd he work for, Bernzy? 

BERNZY 
Spoleto. 

O'BRIEN 
Spoleto and Farinelli. Spoleto and 
Farinelli, all month long. Like rabid 
dogs fightin' over some stinkin' 
bone. 

Bernzy says nothing, keeps his eye to the viewfinder. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - EARLY MORNING 

Bernzy is sitting on the stoop of a magnificent Beaux-Arts 
townhouse. He consults his watch. 

A long black sedan pulls up to the cub, on the opposite side 
of the street. 

Kay gets out, followed by a middle-aged Italian Man in a 
suit and hat. 

Bernzy sits up, watches keenly as they talk, with evident 
agitation. 

Now the Man catches sight of Bernzy, takes Kay's arm rather 
gruffly, and walks her across the street to him. 

MAN 
Bernzy, I want you to tell Kay who I 
am. 

BERNZY 
Kay Levitz, Marc-Antony Spoleto. 

Spoleto's Lieutenant gets out of the car, stands in the 
street. 

SPOLETO 
No -- you to tell her who I am. 

BERNZY 
Mr. Spoleto has the East Side of 
Manhattan all to himself. 

KAY 
Lucky for us we're on the West Side. 

SPOLETO 
That's no way to talk to your new 
partner, Kay. 
(to Bernzy) 
You tell her, Bernzy. 

He walks off. He joins his Lieutenant, who walks him back to 
the car. 

LIEUTENANT 
Bernzy gonna set her straight? 

SPOLETO 
If he's thinkin' straight. 

LIEUTENANT 
(as they climb into 
the car) 
Why wouldn't he be? 

SPOLETO 
Look at him, over there: it's like 
that movie with the Hunchback and 
Sasperilla. 

Bernzy, in his rumpled clothes, stands with Kay, in her 
nightclub finery. 

LIEUTENANT 
Y'mean Esmerelda. 

SPOLETO

Whatever. 

They pull out. 

INT. KAY'S TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER (MORNING) 

Bernzy and Kay sit at the kitchen table. A black Maid is at 
the other end of the enormous room, working; Bernzy speaks 
softly. 

BERNZY 
If somebody could get his hands on 
the gas coupons, if somebody could 
control 'em, there'd be a lot of 
money in it. Like if this was 
Prohibition, and there was only one 
source of liquor. 

KAY 
Lou wouldn't of done that. He has 
two nephews in the service. 

BERNZY 
I'm talking about lot of money. 

KAY 
He wouldn't do that. 

BERNZY 
He did it!... If there's one thing I 
know it's that most people ain't 
human when there's enough money 
involved... I got pictures of guys 
killed over 50 cents. For somebody, 
that was enough. 

She doesn't argue this time. 

KAY 
So that's it? Lou got himself involved 
with these hoods and now I'm stuck 
with them for partners. 

BERNZY 
They don't have partners. You'd be 
out. 

KAY 
(drawing breath) 
I see. 

BERNZY 
Unless. 

KAY 
Unless what? 

He gets up. He moves as he talks. 

BERNZY 
This thing -- this Black Gas -- it's 
big: the Feds are up in arms, there's 
corpses poppin' up all over town, 
who knows who's involved: the Mob, 
definitely; the Feds, probably, maybe 
the cops... What's bigger than the 
War? What's uglier than somebody 
stealing from the fighting boys to 
feather his nest? If I can get just 
one incriminating photo there's a 
front-page uproar, not just tabloids: 
they're exposed, humiliated, indicted. 

KAY 
And I get to keep the club. 

Bernzy nods. She thinks, and then she looks straight at him. 

KAY 
Why're you doing this? 

He looks at her, unwilling or unable to answer. 

The Maid brings them coffee. When she's gone, Bernzy sits 
across from Kay again. 

BERNZY 
I need to know what Spoleto said to 
you. Don't leave out nothing. 

KAY 
He had two men with him, an accountant 
and somebody rough, to intimidate 
me. He said he wanted to see the 
books, and when I refused he said 
"You'd better ask your boyfriend 
about me." 

BERNZY 
Boyfriend? 

KAY 
Yeah... He meant you. 

Bernzy nods. He tries to be matter-of-fact about it. 

KAY 
He knew you'd been there, up in my 
office -- he seemed to know a lot. 

BERNZY 
He's got at least one waiter on the 
payroll by now. 

KAY 
I guess so. Whichever one heard 
Portifino ask you to take his 
portrait. 

BERNZY 
(keenly) 
What? 

KAY 
He said Portifino offered you cash. 

BERNZY 
Who did? 

KAY 
Spoleto. 

BERNZY 
Portifino never offered me -- I never 
even talked to Portifino. 

Bernzy gets up; he starts pacing. 

KAY 
I'm just telling you what he said. 

BERNZY 
That was something I made up when 
Farinelli asked me how I knew 
Portifino... Christ Almighty. 

He is agitated -- knows he onto something. 

KAY 
I don't get it. 

BERNZY 
There was just four or five of us in 
that room -- Farinelli, two of his 
lieutenants, two of his hoods. 

KAY 
(still confused) 
I'm sorry, I -- ? 

BERNZY 
One of Farinelli's men is selling 
information to Spoleto. How else 
could he know that? I made it up on 
the spot. 

KAY 
What're you gonna do? 

CUT TO: 

INT. CAMERA SHOP - DAY 

The clerk rings up a sale for Bernzy in a shop crammed with 
film, cameras, lenses... 

CLERK 
One-sixty-six. 

Bernzy pays the Clerk as he drops a few boxes of film marked 
INFRA-RED into a paper sack. 

CLERK 
You gonna get some more shots in a 
movie house? 

BERNZY 
Someplace even darker, I think. Will 
it work? 

CLERK 
I don't know. Can't say, really. 

The Clerk staples the bag. 

CUT TO: 

INT/EXT. BERNZY'S CAR/SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 

The bag of film from the camera store lies on the seat, torn 
open. Bernzy is already gone from the car. 

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET 

Bernzy walks in shadow, on a self-important Long Island street 
of mock-Tudor houses and stone villas behind low walls. 

EXT. STREET 

Bernzy climbs a six-foot wall, legs waving maladroitly. At 
the top, he peers over, manges to pull himself flat onto the 
wall, then swiftly drops down into 

THE GARDEN 

where he almost breaks his neck: the property drops off 
steeply inside the wall, where a storm drain is covered in 
old ivy. Bernzy squats among the shrubs which are set two 
feet inside the wall. He looks: 

The stone house is guarded by a few men in suits. 

In the bushes, Bernzy extracts a camera from one of his pants 
pockets and a long lens from the other. He begins to screw 
the lens onto the camera body, but freezes when he hears a 
Guard's footsteps crunching on the gravel. 

Bernzy's POV: the Guard swings a flashlight back and forth 
over the path, onto the shrubs, up along the wall. 

When the Guard has passed, Bernzy screws on the lens. He 
aims the camera at the house. 

VIEWFINDER POV: The silhouettes of two men are visible behind 
curtains in a front room, but the laughter of many men can 
be heard. Panning, we see the stone arched entranceway to 
the house. 

A Guard sits on a stone bench on the front porch. He sits 
beneath a tile plaque that says VILLA SPOLETO, illuminated 
by a tiny bulb. This is the only illumination on the porch; 
the rest of it is in near-darkness. 

The front door opens, the Guard stands. It's too dark to see 
the faces of the two men who exit, but Bernzy takes a shot 
anyway -- "blind." The Men then veer camera left to the 
driveway, crossing an area of total darkness. 

He looks at his watch: 11:28. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. GARDEN - LATER 

Bernzy consults his watch, again. 2:12. He hears noises from 
the house, seizes the camera. 

VIEWFINDER POV: The door opens. This time, several men exit, 
alone or in groups of two or three: the meeting is breaking 
up. Bernzy can see no faces, shoots blind. 

They all veer off into the darkness of the driveway. 

He clicks the camera, advances the film -- click, click, 
click. 

ON THE PATH 

two Guards on their rounds hear the soft clicking in the 
shrubs. They move nearer, carefully. The 1st Guard takes the 
gun from his holster, cocks it. 

IN THE BUSH 

Bernzy hears their footfalls, freezes. 

ON THE PATH 

the Guards hear a soft rustling in the bush. The 1st Guard 
takes the gun from his shoulder holster. The two Guards 
advance slowly, shining their lights. 

The 2nd Guard moves to the bush where Bernzy is hiding while 
his partner covers him, gun cocked and aimed. In a swift, 
decisive move, he parts leaves and branches of the bush, 
exposing the ground behind it. REVERSE: 

Bernzy is not to be seen. 

The 2nd Guard shines his beam into the bush, then up along 
the wall. 

Shooting low from the other side of the bushes, we see the 
dirty, ivy-covered storm drain cut into the drop-off at the 
edge of the property. Only Bernzy's white-knuckled hands can 
be seen as he holds on from inside the drain. 

The 2nd Guard drops to his knees, shines his light along the 
base of the wall, under the bushes: he is right over Bernzy. 

We see into the drain, where Bernzy is having a hard time 
holding on. The Guard is painstakingly thorough in his 
examination of the area behind the bushes. After an eternity: 

GUARD 2 
Must be them squirrels. 

He releases the bush and he gets up. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - LATER 

Bernzy works feverishly in his darkroom. He coaxes a print 
to life by agitating a tub. In fact, he has two tubs, and he 
moves from one to the next in his zeal to see the pictures. 
We see into one of the tubs: 

The lighter parts of the picture have appeared -- the stone 
bench, the plaque which says VILLA SPOLETO... Now slowly the 
faces of two men come into view, i.e., what was invisible to 
the naked eye is visible to the infra-red. 

Bernzy grasps the print with tweezers, hangs it onto the 
drying line. 

DISSOLVE TO: 

INT. DARKROOM - LATER 

Now the drying line is filled with shots of men leaving 
Spoleto's house. 

Bernzy is still over the chemical tub; he hasn't found the 
face he seeks. 

BERNZY 
C'mon -- come on! 

Now a face comes slowly into view, on the dark part of the 
porch. It is SAL, the lean-faced lieutenant who was sitting 
on the couch in Farinelli's office when Farinelli grilled 
Bernzy. He is on Spoleto's arm in the picture. 

BERNZY 
Sal, you beautiful jerk. 

He lifts the photo out of the tub, triumphantly. But then 
his eye catches sight of the photo now coming to life in the 
second tub: 

A Man in a conservative blue suit -- a WASPY gray eminence -- 
is coming out of Spoleto's front door. 

BERNZY 
(quietly) 
Holy shit. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - LATER (MORNING) 

Bernzy, at his desk, takes up a finished print of Sal. He 
puts it in an envelope. He writes on it in grease-pencil: 
FARINELLI. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT 

CLOSE ON the palm of the Italian Maitre d' as a Man slips a 
bill into it. 

The MAN, in a dinner jacket, has a stern but florid face; 
his Wife has a supercilious bearing. As they move: 

MAN 
Table No. 7, Fredo. 

MAITRE 'D 
I'm afraid Mrs. Levitz is at No. 7 
this evening, Mr. Brown. 

The Man looks across the room as they move. He sees Kay 
sitting across from Bernzy; they speak intently. 

MAN 
(not concealing his 
distaste) 
Who's the gentleman? 

MAITRE D' 
I believe he's a poet who recently 
escaped Mr. Hitler. 

MAN 
That's still no excuse, is it. 

MAITRE D' 
No, sir... Exactly. 

He pulls out a chair for the Wife with an old-world flourish. 

ON BERNZY and KAY. Bernzy slides the envelope marked Farinelli 
across the table cloth. 

BERNZY 
This is an incriminating picture of 
the informer, Sal Minetto. 

Kay takes the envelope. They sit in a banquette, the music 
playing across the room. 

BERNZY 
You got a safe or something? At home? 

She nods. 

BERNZY 
If I wind up dead, you give the 
picture to Frank Farinelli; but I'm 
giving you the picture, which 
guarantees I ain't gonna wind up 
dead. 

KAY 
I understand. 

She slides the letter into a beaded pocketbook, lying on the 
table, next to an open bottle of expensive Scotch. 

Bernzy looks around him -- the beautiful nightclub, its well- 
dressed patrons, the polished musicians. 

BERNZY 
My father's been in this country 27 
years, it's like he never left Russia. 
Sittin' here, I know just what he 
must feel like. 

KAY 
Means you need another drink. 
(she pours him one) 
That's how they all get the impression 
they belong. 

BERNZY 
That's all it takes, huh? 

She nods. They drink. A beat. 

KAY 
You okay? 

BERNZY 
It's startin' to work. 

She smiles. The music plays, something lush and evocative. 
For a long, exquisite moment he really does believe he 
belongs. 

But then a dapper Man in dinner clothes leans over Kay, drapes 
his arm over her. 

MAN 
Kay! 

KAY 
Henry, how are you? 
(she comes to her 
feet) 
Please meet my friend Leon Bernstein. 
Bernzy, this is Henry Haddock, Jr. 

HADDOCK 
Mr. Bernstein. 
(turning instantly to 
Kay) 
I've half the M.G.M. brass over there, 
dying to meet you. 

KAY 
Of course. 

She turns back to Bernzy. 

BERNZY 
G'ahead. 

She scoops up the bag with the letter, nods soberly to Bernzy 
(i.E., she let's him know she won't let go of it) and walks 
off with Haddock, who circles his arm around her. He whispers 
in her ear and she laughs musically. 

We hold on Bernzy, alone at the table, watching Kay -- ever- 
charming, ever-beautiful, meeting half a dozen men in dinner 
jackets. Bernzy is suffering. 

He gets up abruptly, heads for the door. 

We hold for a moment on the glittering club, as the music 
swells and people laugh, and then abruptly we 

CUT TO: 

EXT. QUEENS APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT 

Bernzy stands in a dreary silent street in Queens. The club 
could be a million miles away. 

He holds a page from the phone book. A name, address and 
phone number are underlined -- those of SALVATORE MINETTO. 

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - SAME 

A Woman holds the door partly ajar to speak to Bernzy. 

WOMAN 
Hold on. I'll get him. 

Bernzy waits. We can hear a comedy program on somebody's 
radio echoing down the hall. Now Sal comes to the door, in 
an undershirt. 

BERNZY 
I'm Bernzy. The photographer -- 

SAL 
I know who you are. 

BERNZY 
I'd like to come in. 

SAL 
What for? 

BERNZY 
It has t'd do with Mr. Farinelli. 
(quietly) 
And Mr. Spoleto. 

Sal opens the door. Bernzy enters. 

INT. APARTMENT 

He follows Sal through a foyer, into a salon, with high dark 
furniture and worn doilies. 

Sal's wife, listening to "Amos 'n' Andy" on the radio, watches 
them pass. 

INT. KITCHEN 

Sal closes the door behind them, hooks the latch. Bernzy, 
meantime, takes an envelope marked "SAL" from his pocket. 

SAL 
You got your nerve comin' here, little 
man. 

Bernzy gives the envelope to Sal. 

BERNZY 
Open it. 

Sal stares at Bernzy angrily for a beat. He takes up a steak 
knife from the counter, lets it rest ominously in his palm. 
But then he uses to knife to slice open the envelope. 

Seeing the picture of himself with Spoleto, he merely stares. 

BERNZY 
There's three others just like it, 
in sealed envelopes marked 
'Farinelli.' I gave 'em to people I 
trust. Anything happens to me, they 
get sent to Farinelli. 

Sal continues to stare at the photo. 

SAL 
I don't have no money. 

BERNZY 
I don't want any. 

CUT TO: 

INT. KITCHEN - LATER 

Bernzy paces, listening keenly. 

Sal sits at the plain wood table, with a bottle of beer, 
running through the story quickly, in the present tense. 

SAL 
Portifino's just a stupid punk in 
D.C. but he's fronting for somebody 
willing to sell him the stamps from 
inside the A.P.O. 

BERNZY 
O.P.A. 

SAL 
Huh? 

BERNZY 
Office of Price Administration. 

SAL 
Yeah, right. But then he can't figure 
how to unload 'em. Knows nobody. The 
heads of the Five Families won't 
touch 'em on account of their gettin' 
amnesty from the Feds to work with 
the Italian mobs against Mussolini. 
Then he hears Lou Levitz on some 
radio show: Friend to the Stars, one- 
time bootlegger, Mr. New York... He 
figures maybe an old-timer like Levitz 
knows how to unload hot coupons. 
Levitz is interested, alright: he's 
got a hot young wife to support -- 

Bernzy looks up keenly -- 

SAL 
and he sees there's maybe millions 
in it. He don't have to lift a finger: 
he just turns the stamps over to 
Spoleto for a fat percentage. Would 
you siddown, please?! 

BERNZY 
(he doesn't siddown) 
Levitz' wife knew about it? 

SAL 
I didn't say that. 

BERNZY 
Did she? 

SAL 
How should I know. 

BERNZY 
(pacing again) 
Go on. 

SAL 
Then Levitz dies. 
(sniggering) 
I guess the old Jew was makin' so 
much he figured he was in Heaven 
already. 

Bernzy stops pacing; Sal realizes his "gaffe," which seems 
intentional. 

SAL 
Whoops... Anyway, Portifino's such a 
half-wit he figures with the middle- 
man dead he's free to sell the stamps 
to somebody else. By this time, he's 
met Farinelli, so he goes to him. 
Never mentions Spoleto. The asshole. 
He signed his death warrant. End of 
story. 

He throws up his hands with finality, gets out of the chair. 

BERNZY 
Wait a second. Didn't they lose the 
source? The inside man? 

SAL 
They tortured him first, got the 
name of the source. 

BERNZY 
Who's they? Who killed him? 

SAL 
Who knows. Everybody was after this 
guy. 

BERNZY 
Who killed him? 

SAL 
Farinelli. 

Bernzy paces, cogitates. 

BERNZY 
So Farinelli gets the name and kills 
him. Which means Spoleto doesn't 
know the name till you tell him. 

Sal goes to the ice-box. He blinks nervously. 

SAL 
Yeah, I guess so. 

BERNZY 
Gee, Sal: isn't Farinelli gonna be 
upset about that? 

SAL 
(getting a bottle 
opener from the drawer) 
Who knows? 

Bernzy reaches into his pocket, takes another print of Sal, 
tosses it into the drawer. 

BERNZY 
'Who knows'? You're not stupid. What's 
Spoleto gonna do to protect you? 

Sal snatches the picture from the drawer, stuffs it in his 
pocket. 

Bernzy takes out another print, wedges it between the salt 
and pepper shakers. 

BERNZY 
What's Spoleto gonna do? 

SAL 
(snatching up the 
photo) 
Would you stop?! I told you what I 
know. 

Bernzy drops a print to the floor. 

Sal is about to retrieve it, but sees it's futile. Bernzy is 
already holding another print. 

BERNZY 
Is Spoleto gonna assassinate 
Farinelli? Is that it? 

SAL 
(softly, resigned) 
No. It's worse. Much worse. 

BERNZY 
Tell me, Sal. 

Sal sinks back into the kitchen chair, drops his face into 
his hands. 

BERNZY 
Tell me. 

Bernzy flips another print; it flutters to the floor, lands 
at Sal's feet, where he stares down, head in hands. 

Sal mutters two words into his hands. We don't hear them, 
they're lost... 

But Bernzy seems to hear them. His face grows keen. 

BERNZY 
What? 

Sal looks up angrily, filled with self-disgust. 

SAL 
A massacre, you son of a bitch, a 
massacre! Spoleto's gonna wipe out 
Farinelli's whole gang -- all my 
paesan -- and I'm gonna tell him 
where and when. 

Bernzy stares at Sal with astonishment as he slowly takes a 
seat across from him. He is silent. This is more than he 
bargained for. Eventually he speaks, quietly. 

BERNZY 
I need to know where and when too, 
Sal. You're gonna tell me where and 
when too, okay? 

SAL 
(disbelieving) 
Whaddo you wanna know for? If you're 
thinkin of goin' to the Feds, they 
just wanna cover this up. 

Bernzy is thinking. Sal shouts. 

SAL 
Whadda you wanna know for?! 

Bernzy looks up. A beat. Then: 

BERNZY 
I wanna take some pictures. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bernzy is hunched over his portable typewriter, pecking away. 

He pulls the page out of the matchine -- a single-spaced 
letter -- and reads it, mumbling and pacing. 

He sits back at the desk, signs the letter, takes up an 
envelope (beneath which Kay's photo still lies on the desk), 
puts the letter inside, and seals it. On the envelope he 
writes: MR. ARTHUR NABLER, BEEKMAN APARTMENTS, then TO BE 
OPENED IN THE -- 

At which point the telephone rings. 

BERNZY 
H'lo? 
(he listens) 
Awright, don't move: I'm coming. 

CUT TO: 

INT. KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 

Kay, in a bathrobe, visibly shaken, opens the door, and Bernzy 
comes in. He takes her by the arms. 

BERNZY 
What happened? What'd he do? 

He backs her deeper into the foyer, back toward the imposing 
staircase. 

KAY 
He was here with three men... thugs... 
and he kept asking -- 

He eases her onto the stairs, where they sit -- 

KAY 
-- "Who's the source, Kay? Who's the 
inside man?" 

BERNZY 
Did he hit you? 

KAY 
(she shakes her head) 
He says that comes next time. 

BERNZY 
It's bullshit. He knows the name. 
Sal told him. He just wants to know 
if you know. You're trouble if you 
know... You don't know, right? 

KAY 
No! I didn't even know what he was 
talking about! 

BERNZY 
(penitent) 
I know, I know, I didn't mean that... 
Lou had no right t'do this thing to 
you. He didn't deserve you. He didn't 
know what he had -- he didn't -- 

Bernzy draws up short when he realizes what he's saying, 
what boundary he's crossed. A beat. He clear his throat. 

He digs in his pocket and takes out the picture of the gray 
eminence on Spoleto's porch. 

BERNZY 
Know this guy? 

KAY 
Thatcher White. He comes to the club. 
He's a big lawyer in Washington. 

BERNZY 
He was the Governor of Philadelphia. 
He had cabinet posts in two Republican 
administrations. He has an honorary 
post at the Office of Price 
Administration. 

KAY 
(joking) 
He my partner, too? 

When Bernzy says nothing -- merely puts the picture away -- 
she realizes it's true, realizes how big this thing is. 

KAY 
(frightened) 
My God. 

BERNZY 
Don't worry about it. They're finished 
when I get the pictures. They're all 
a bunch of bums when I get the 
pictures. 

KAY 
Pictures of what, Bernzy? 

CUT TO: 

INT. MOVIE HOUSE - NIGHT 

OPEN ON the screen, which shows a newsreel about the War 
effort. It is strong stuff -- Nazis on the march, smudge- 
faced G.I.'s in foxholes, coffins of Americans, draped with 
the flag. 

Bernzy sits alone in the giant movie house -- but he looks 
anxiously up the aisle -- expecting somebody. 

The newsreel concludes with a fervent pitch for fuel 
conservation: "Remember, every gallon you save could mean 
the life of a boy Over There." 

As the cartoon comes on, Sal slinks into the theatre, takes 
the seat next to Bernzy's. 

SAL 
Farinelli takes all the boys to dinner 
every so often. He's takin' us Friday. 
That's when he's hit. 

BERNZY 
Where? What time? 

SAL 
Dinner's at eight. I get up to take 
a leak at 8:15. Spoleto's men come 
in a minute later. 

BERNZY 
Where? 

SAL 
I don't know where, yet. We never 
do. He always calls us around 6:30, 
the day of the dinner. 
(with bitter irony) 
F'r safety... It's usually some little 
family place or other. In Little 
Italy. 

BERNZY 
(wincing) 
Fam'ly? 

SAL 
Don't worry. He takes the whole place 
over f'r the night. 

BERNZY 
Call me as soon as you hear on Friday. 
Even before you call Spoleto. 

SAL 
(shaking his head) 
Spoleto's lieutenant's gonna be with 
me when the call comes. But he'll 
leave right after. Then I call you. 

BERNZY 
Don't fail me, Sal. 

We see the cartoon on the screen: some creature gets blown 
up with dynamite, or has a safe fall on his head. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

We are on the door as Bernzy's key scratches in the lock. He 
comes in, wearily, closes the door behind him. He is startled 
when he hears a voice behind him. 

VOICE 
H'lo, Bernzy. 

Bernzy swings around, startled. 

A figure sits in the darkness, at Bernzy's desk. He switches 
on the light. It's Arthur Nabler. 

NABLER 
I came to apologize for the other 
night. 

Bernzy looks at his desk: Nabler's hat sits over the spot 
where the letter is (or was) lying. 

NABLER 
The crazy thing is, I'm in love with 
Miss Hixon. 

BERNZY 
Yeah. I kinda figured... You didn't 
by any chance -- 

Nabler lifts his hat off the envelope: it's torn open, now. 

NABLER 
It was addressed to me. It said "To 
be opened --" 

BERNZY 
"In the event of my death." Only I 
got kinda busy. I didn't get that 
far. 

NABLER 
I figured -- once I opened it... 
Why're you doing this, Bernzy? 

BERNZY 
Why? It's what I do, ain't it? 
(he gestures at the 
tabloid pictures 
pinned everywhere) 
Murders, fires, drunks: Life, as it 
happens. My motto for 23 years. 

NABLER 
This is death as it happens. 

BERNZY 
That's the main thing about life, 
isn't it? Death? I mean, half the 
shots are get are somebody just Before 
or just After. For once I'll get 
During. 

NABLER 
You could stop it. Go to the cops. 

BERNZY 
Really? Think that'd stop it? You 
been spendin' too much time at Cafe 
Society. It's a war, Arty, these 
guys aren't gonna lay off. They're 
gonna do it fast or they're gonna do 
it slow, but they're gonna do it... 
Why don't you tell them photographers 
in Europe to stop the War? 

NABLER 
It's not their war -- 

BERNZY 
This ain't mine. 

NABLER 
Isn't it? 

BERNZY 
What's that supposed to mean? 

NABLER 
I thought you never took sides, 
Bernzy. 

BERNZY 
What're you gettin' at? 

NABLER 
You're doing it for her. 

BERNZY 
You're nuts. 

NABLER 
Am I? 

Bernzy looks at Nabler a beat -- incensed by his glib 
certitude -- then grabs one of his cigar box files and empties 
its contents onto the desk: the photos rain down in abundance, 
covering the desk and spilling onto the floor. They all show 
fires: buildings ablaze, people running from blazes, firemen 
carrying children from blazes. As the camera plays over this 
fantastic display, Bernzy goes to grab another file. 

BERNZY 
Here it is, Arty: the whole history 
of New York here with me in this 
dump, and it ain't because I went 
around interferin' -- hosing down 
fires or tellin' people to behave 
nice -- 

Bernzy unloads an equally plentiful load of dead gangsters 
onto the desk and floor -- growing more and more passionate 
in his own defense -- 

BERNZY 
They pay people to do that stuff -- 
cops, firemen... I'm an artist -- 
you're fuckin' right, I am -- and I 
let people do whatever the hell 
they're gonna do 'cause that's the 
only way I can do it right! 

Nabler grabs Bernzy's arm just as he's about to unload a 
third file. 

NABLER 
Stop it!... Jesus, Bernzy, I may be 
the only one in New York who thinks 
you are an artist instead of some 
kind of animal -- and even I'm not 
so sure about this thing. It has a 
stink to it... 
(he shakes his head) 
Still, if I thought you were doing 
it for some kind of crazy fame or 
glory, I wouldn't say a word. I know 
how much it hurts to be ignored -- 
not even reviled, just ignored. But 
if you're doing it for her, you're 
risking your life for nothing. For 
less than nothing. 

BERNZY 
You're gettin' me and you mixed up. 

NABLER 
I hope so. She's cold, Bernzy. She 
took old Lou Levitz for everything 
he was worth and everybody knows it. 

BERNZY 
(dismissing this) 
She's just like everybody else in 
New York, makin' the best of what 
she has. 

NABLER 
No... Maybe I have been spending too 
much time at Cafe Society -- just 
like you've been on the street too 
long... You give your whole life to 
something nobody could love and you 
wind up a sitting duck. You know 
everything about everything, except 
what other people take for granted. 

BERNZY 
That's enough, Arty. 

NABLER 
A mansion on the West Side, a place 
on the South Shore -- she milked 
Levitz so dry he sold himself to a 
worm like Spoleto. I wouldn't be 
surprised if she was in this thing 
from the first. 

Bernzy, incensed, grabs Nabler by the collar -- 

NABLER 
You don't hit people, Bernzy. You 
can stare at things that'd make a 
brute squeamish. But you don't hit 
people. That's not what we do, people 
like us. 

Bernzy looks at Nabler. He knows he's right. He lets go of 
him, walks to the door, opens it. 

BERNZY 
G'night, Arty. Thanks for the apology. 

Nabler puts his hat on. He moves to the door. He speaks with 
sincerity. 

NABLER 
Do me a favor, Bernzy. Tell her what 
you're gonna do. Tell her you're 
gonna attend a shootout. If she has 
any feelings at all for you, she'll 
try and stop you. 

Nabler goes out the door. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT 

Bernzy stands near the entrance, holding his book of 
photographs. He stares across the room to a far table where 
KAY sits with a large group of well-dressed Men and Women. 
They're drinking champagne and martinis. A Man is telling a 
story. Everyone -- Kay included -- laughs riotously. 

Bernzy turns to the Italian Maitre d' at his side. 

BERNZY 
Give this to Mrs. Levitz, wouldja? 
Tell her I'll pick it up Saturday. 

MAITRE D' 
You don't wish to -- ? 

BERNZY 
Changed my mind. 

Bernzy watches as everyone at the table laughs again. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BOWERY BAR - NIGHT 

A toothless WOMAN sings the last line of a ribald bar song 
in a filthy place with sawdust on the floor. Those drunks 
who are still conscious (many lie with their heads on the 
tables) applaud haphazardly. 

Bernzy takes a flash shot and the Woman raises her glass to 
him. He finds his own glass and raises it to her. He's in 
his element, here. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CAFE SOCIETY - NIGHT 

CLOSE ON Bernzy's book. A female hand turns the pages. As we 
see one vivid, ironic or profound vignette after another (a 
cleaning woman mopping the floor in Grand Central, her human 
scale diminished by the overspreading dome; Puerto Rican 
teenagers sleeping on a fire escape; an old man carrying all 
his possessions from his burning tenement) we begin to 
understand the power of the book as a book: it's a complete 
world. 

Some of the pictures have captions, e.g.: a picture of a 
corpse -- THE STAR ATTRACTION -- alongside a picture of the 
excited crowd which has gathered: FIRST NIGHTERS. 

They're cleaning up the club around Kay; chairs are overturned 
on tables. She picks up the book, and heads for the door. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - DAWN 

Bernzy is sleeping. The police radio hisses. He stirs. 

Kay stands over him, still in her evening clothes. She's 
holding the book. 

KAY 
Why're you giving this to me? 

Bernzy clears his throat as he pulls a pair of trousers from 
a chair next to the bed, drags them on, gets out of the bed. 

BERNZY 
You shouldn't be here, Kay. This is 
really no place f'r you t'be. 

Disconcerted by her presence here, he drags the cover over 
the bed, makes a rushed and futile attempt to tidy the place 
up. (The photos he dumped onto the desk and floor still lie 
on the desk and floor.) 

BERNZY 
Didn't -- didn't that maitre d' tell 
you? I just wanted you to hold onto 
this, that's all. Just till after -- 

He trails off. 

KAY 
After what, Bernzy? 

He looks at her. Nabler's advice is ringing in his head. 

BERNZY 
It's somethin' nobody ever got 
pictures of before. Nobody else ever 
will. 

KAY 
What is? 

BERNZY 
(almost defensively) 
If I guy could get pictures of a 
live volcano, say, that would be 
worth it, right? 

KAY 
What're these pictures, Bernzy? Why're 
you afraid to tell me? 

He takes a seat on the bed. He can't look at her. 

BERNZY 
So far you don't seem to go along 
with the popular view that I'm some 
kind of an insect. 

KAY 
Is it gonna be so much worse than 
what I've seen in here? 
(She's still holding 
his book.) 

BERNZY 
Yeah. Yeah it's worse. 
(a beat) 
Spoleto's wiping out Farinelli's 
whole gang. A massacre. 

He watches her, watches keenly for her reaction. But it's 
hard to read: she seems stunned, but keeps it to herself. 

KAY 
What happens if they see you? 

BERNZY 
I know what I'm doing. 

KAY 
Then why're you giving me the book? 

BERNZY 
They ain't gonna see me. 

KAY 
Bernzy -- why're you doing this? 

BERNZY 
Why? 

She looks at him, and he looks at her. Perhaps he doesn't 
know the answer. 

BERNZY 
It -- it's what I do, that's all. 

She looks at him. 

KAY 
That's all? 

He nods. 

Is she disappointed -- or relieved. 

KAY 
When. 

BERNZY 
Don't ask me that. 

KAY 
Bernzy, please -- 

BERNZY 
No! 

A beat. 

KAY 
Do you wanna make love to me, Bernzy? 

BERNZY 
Why're you asking? 'Cause you think 
I'm gonna die? 

She starts to leave; he grabs her hand. 

BERNZY 
I didn't mean that. 

He brings her face to his almost urgently and kisses her on 
the mouth. 

KAY 
Wait -- please -- 

She walks to the police radio, still crackling, and switches 
it off. We hold on the radio as she steps out of frame. 

KAY 
Okay, Bernzy. Now. 

Still holding on the radio, we begin a 

SHORT FADE: 

FADE IN: 

INT. BERNZY'S APT. - DAY 

OPEN ON the day-date calendar on Bernzy's desk. It's torn to 
FRIDAY. Panning, we find Bernzy's hands, rummaging on the 
desk for something. 

Amid two or three open boxes of INFRA-RED film, and two roll- 
loading cameras, Bernzy finds a ball of string. He is holding 
a doorstop (a graded piece of wood). 

With the string, he deftly ties the camera piggyback to the 
doorstop, sets the timer, puts the camera on the floor. The 
lens is angled up toward body level. 

The shutter kicks down toward zero, making a distinct sound, 
ki-ki-ki-ki-ki. But it stuck around five seconds. 

BERNZY 
Dammit. 

He picks it up, finds an oil can, puts a drop of oil on the 
timer, sets it again. Ki-ki-ki, etc. This time it ticks down 
to zero, and the shutter clicks. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APT - LATER 

Bernzy, pacing, consults his watch. It's almost 6:30. 

CUT TO: 

INT. SPOLETO'S OFFICE - SAME 

Spoleto paces behind his desk, consults his watch. His office 
is more richly furnished than Farinelli's. 

CUT TO: 

INT. SAL'S APARTMENT - EVENING 

Sal paces the hallway of his apartment, consults his watch. 

Spoleto's LIEUTENANT watches him. The phone, sitting on a 
high table in the hallway, rings. Sal seizes it. 

SAL 
(into the phone; 
cheerfully) 
Hello? Hi, Mr. Farinelli. d'Angelo's 
Cafe. Sure, I know it. See y'later. 

He hangs up the phone, his artificial cheeriness gone. 

SAL 
d'Angelo's -- I guess you heard. 

LIEUTENANT 
d'Angelo's. 
(sympathetically) 
You're feelin' kinda rotten, huh? 

SAL 
You know it. 

LIEUTENANT 
(putting on his hat) 
You'll get over it. 

The Lieutenant pulls a gun, wrapped in a rag, from his coat. 

We hold on Sal's uncomprehending eyes as the gun fires twice. 
Sal falls to the floor as the Lieutenant flees. 

Sal's wife comes into the hallway, begins shrieking. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - EVENING 

Bernzy, muttering nervously, occupies himself by gathering 
up the photos he spilled onto the desk, collecting them back 
into their cigar box files... 

BERNZY 
C'mon, Sal, come on... 

He consults his watch. 7:08. 

DISSOLVE TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - LATER 

The alarm clock says 7:20. 

Bernzy paces. The files have been completely restored and 
sit neatly on the desk. 

Bernzy moves briskly to a chair with a pair of trousers draped 
over its back. He goes through the pockets, unfolding scraps 
of paper and old flashbulbs, till he finds what he wants: 
the page of the phone book with Sal's name, address and phone 
number. 

He goes to the phone, dials. 

BERNZY 
(into phone) 
Lemme speak to Sal, please. 
(listening) 
Oh. God. I'm sorry. 

Bernzy hangs up the phone. He sinks into his chair, stunned 
and defeated. He knocks the newly re-filed boxes of pictures 
off the desk; they go scattering in every direction. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

The Lieutenant of Spoleto who killed Sal pulls up across 
from Bernzy's apartment. He kills the engine, sets the 
handbrake. 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - SAME 

Bernzy, still sunk into his seat, suddenly comes up, infused 
with new vigor. 

He rummages through a disorganized bookshself, seized by 
some sort of inspiration, mumbling to himself. 

BERNZY 
...'he takes the place over'... 
'always takes the place over'... 

He finds a book, plonks it onto the desk, takes a seat. 

ON the PHONE BOOK: he pages through quickly till he finds a 
page headed RESTAURANTS. The numbers are listed 
geographically, i.e., EAST SIDE, WEST SIDE, CHINATOWN. 

Bernzy's finger finds the column titled LITTLE ITALY. He 
starts from the top, dials a number. As it rings, he consults 
his watch. Twenty of eight. 

PHONE VOICE (V.O.) 
Bonotelli's. 

BERNZY 
I need a reservation f'r tonight. 

PHONE VOICE (V.O.) 
Of course, for what time? 

Bernzy hangs up. His finger moves to the next number. He 
consults his Timex, again. 

INT. /EXT. LIEUTENANT'S CAR/STREET - SAME 

Spoleto's lieutenant is wrapping his gun in a fresh rag. 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - SAME 

Bernzy holds the phone. 

ITALIAN VOICE (V.O.) 
Clam House. 

BERNZY 
I need a reservation for tonight. 

ITALIAN VOICE (V.O.) 
Yes, and what's the name, please? 

Bernzy hangs up the phone, again. 

EXT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - SAME 

Spoleto's Lieutenant holds the door for an Old Woman leaving 
Bernzy's apartment. He tips his hat, and enters. 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - SAME 

Bernzy is on the phone, checking his watch, as the phone 
rings. 

We see the page of the phone book: seven restaurants have 
been crossed off. 

BERNZY 
I need a reservation for tonight. 

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) 
(Italian accent) 
We all booked tonight. 

BERNZY 
Already? 

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) 
Private party tonight. 

BERNZY 
(sitting up keenly) 
Oh yeah, sorry to hear that. Maybe 
tomorrow... You still at the same 
address? 

INT. HALLWAY - SAME 

The Lieutenant approaches Bernzy's door quietly. 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - SAME 

Bernzy tears the page from the phone book, grabs his hat, 
his camera, the camera affixed to the piece of wood... 

Someone knocks on the door. 

He looks up. 

INT. HALLWAY - SAME 

The Lieutenant waits. He knocks again. 

INT. BERNZY'S APT - SAME 

Bernzy is frozen, as he sees the doorknob rotate, one way, 
then the other. 

INT. HALLWAY - SAME 

The Lieutenant picks the cheap lock almost effortlessly. 

INT. APARTMENT 

He takes his gun out as he enters the darkened apartment. He 
swings around when he hears a Voice. 

It's the police radio. 

He moves stealthfully past the darkroom -- sees the photos 
hanging on the line... 

Then into the bathroom. Now he sees Bernzy's silhouette, 
behind the shower curtain, cowering in the stall. He aims 
his gun at it, then swiftly draws back the curtain. 

It isn't Bernzy: it's an old fashioned portrait camera, with 
a hood, on a tripod. 

MAIN ROOM 

The Lieutenant returns, switches on the light. He sees the 
curtain swaying in the breeze. He crosses to the window, 
parts the curtains. HIS POV: 

Bernzy has descended the fire escape. 

CUT TO: 

INT. EXT/BERNZY'S CAR - NIGHT 

Bernzy watches in frustration as a Workman guides a truck 
which is backing up into the street, blocking traffic in 
both directions. Bernzy slams the wheel, curses his luck. 

He looks at his watch. Four minutes before eight. 

The moment the narrowest semblance of a lane is clear, he 
passes two other cars and drives through the narrow gap, 
passes it, and speeds away. 

CUT TO: 

INT. BERNZY'S APARTMENT - SAME 

The Lieutenant is on the phone. 

LIEUTENANT 
(into phone) 
I looked. He ain't here. 

INTERCUT TO: 

INT. SPOLETO'S OFFICE - NIGHT 

Spoleto, on the other end of the line. 

SPOLETO 
(he thinks; into phone) 
No matter; we'll get him later. 

He hangs up the phone. He looks over to THATCHER WHITE, the 
Republican gray eminence. 

SPOLETO 
Bernstein got away. 

White glares, as if at an incompetent servant. 

SPOLETO 
We'll go ahead with the hit, as 
planned. 

WHITE 
Is that really wise, Mr. Spoleto? 

SPOLETO 
He don't know where it's gonna happen. 
He don't know it's d'Angelo's. We're 
home free. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. D'ANGELO'S CAFE - NIGHT 

d'Angelo's is a simple storefront building with a plate glass 
window, filmy curtains, a plainly-lettered sign. A neon clock 
in the window says TIME TO EAT. 

Right now it's two minutes before eight. 

REVERSE: 

BERNZY stands across the street from d'Angelo's. He has his 
camera around his neck, the time release camera in hand. 

Through the filmy curtains he can see that no one is eating 
inside, i.e., no one from Farinelli's gang has arrived yet. 

One door down from d'Angelo's, he sees a gap between the 
buildings which leads to a rear alley. He looks both ways 
before crossing the street quickly. 

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND D'ANGELO'S 

Through the screen door, Bernzy can see a black Scullion in 
an apron. He scrapes potato peelings into a metal can by the 
door. Beyond him, we can see d'ANGELO and MRS. d'ANGELO, the 
middle-aged couple who run the place. They are preparing 
food at the stove. 

Bernzy gestures to the Scullion, trying to lure him out into 
the alley with bills he waves in his hand. 

The Scullion looks at his boss, back at Bernzy. He picks up 
the metal can, and walks it back into the alley. 

BERNZY 
Listen, whaddo they pay you here? 

The Scullion empties the trash into the dumpster. 

BERNZY 
Two-fifty? Three bucks a week? 

The Scullion just stares. 

BERNZY 
(giving him three 
bills) 
Here's two month's pay. 
(and another one) 
Here's three months, I got no time 
to haggle. 

SCULLION 
What'you want? 

INT. KITCHEN 

The Scullion re-enters. He picks up a tray of water glasses 
and looks to the Chef. The Chef nods. The Scullion carries 
them toward the dining room, passing through a narrow 

HALLWAY 

that connects it to the kitchen. 

DINING ROOM 

Four square tables have been pushed together to create a 
single rectangular table in the center of the restaurant. 
The cafe's other tables have been pushed to the outside walls, 
for tonight's private party. 

The Scullion sets the tray with water glasses on one of the 
tables pushed to the side. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. D'ANGELO'S - SAME 

Bernzy stands pressed against the front door, looking at his 
watch. It's 8 o'clock. He watches the street nervously as A 
DARK SEDAN turns the corner onto the street, up the block. 

BERNZY 
Fuck. 

The Scullion unlocks the door behind him and Bernzy ducks 
in. 

INT. DINING ROOM 

The Scullion leads Bernzy through the dining room back toward 
the hallway, cautioning Bernzy to wait while he makes sure 
the coast is clear. 

EXT. STREET 

The car pulls up in front. 

INT. D'ANGELO'S HALLWAY 

Bernzy is moving one of the tables pushed to the side of the 
restaurant closer to the hallway. Through the curtained 
window, he sees FARINELLI getting out of his car. 

Bernzy ducks down beneath the level of the windows. He adjusts 
the table cloth of the table he just moved, bringing it closer 
to the floor on the dining room side. 

The Scullion opens the door of a closet in the hallway, and 
beckons Bernzy to come. 

Bernzy looks behind him, to the door, as he scurries, low, 
toward the closet door. 

THE CLOSET 

is ridiculously cramped -- filled with mops, brooms, buckets, 
lightbulbs. Just as FARINELLI opens the cafe's front door 
The Scullion lifts a broom in the closet and Bernzy ducks 
under it. 

DINING ROOM 

Farinelli sees the Scullion replacing a broom in a closet, 
and closing the closet door. 

The Chef hurries down the hallway, past the Scullion, to 
greet Farinelli and his Men. There is a great deal of 
obsequiousness and hand-kissing. Everyone speaks in Italian. 

EXT. STREET 

Another car pulls up, and four more of Farinelli's men get 
out of it. 

INT. CLOSET 

Bernzy, impossibly cramped in the dim closet, gingerly lifts 
a roll loaded camera on a strap out of his oversized jacket 
pocket. He can hear the Italian voices. A bucket wobbles and 
he has to freeze. He secures the bucket, and lifts the camera 
strap over his head and onto his shoulders. 

INT. DINING ROOM 

Farinelli and his men are sitting down as three more gang 
members enter. 

INT. CLOSET 

Bernzy looks at his watch. It's ten past eight. He's soaked 
in sweat and very cramped. He can hear the muffled voices of 
Farinelli and his men. We can feel the heat, the darkness, 
the anxiety of this claustrophobic eternity. 

INT. DINING ROOM 

The Chef is serving wine around the table as Farinelli, at 
its head, speaks in subtitled Italian. 

FARINELLI 
I got some news just before I left 
the house... This time it's Sal. 

The Men take the news without evident emotion. 

FARINELLI 
(to the Chef) 
Leave us. 

The Chef nods, and heads up the hallway. 

INT. CLOSET 

Bernzy checks his watch. He gingerly shifts his position, in 
order to remove the time-release camera, on its graded piece 
of wood, from his other suit pocket. He can hear the muffled 
Italian voices, outside: they're discussing how to avenge 
Sal's death. 

EXT./INT. ALLEY BEHIND D'ANGELOS/CAR 

A long car idles in the alley. 

Inside are four of SPOLETO'S MEN, carrying automatic weapons, 
and a Driver. The Lead Assassin studies his watch. 

INT. CLOSET 

Bernzy studies his watch, then sets the timer on the time- 
release camera. 

INT. KITCHEN 

The d'Angelos set the last few pieces onto an antipasto 
platter. 

The screen door is yanked back: Spoleto's men run through 
the back door. d'Angelo, Mrs. d'Angelo and the Scullion drop 
their utensils and duck down behind the counter. 

Mrs. d'Angelo crosses herself. 

INT. CLOSET 

Bernzy hears the running footsteps of the Assassins. In one 
hand he holds the time-release camera; the other grips the 
knob of the closet door. 

DINING ROOM 

As Spoleto's Men come into the dining room, a few of 
Farinelli's men see them and go for their guns. But Spoleto's 
men already have their guns ready and aimed. 

LEAD ASSASSIN 
Don't try it. On your feet. 

Behind him, we see the broom-closet door sway open slowly. 

INT. KITCHEN 

The d'Angelos and the Scullion crawl out by the screen door. 

INT. DINING ROOM 

Spoleto's men are arrayed (weapons aimed) on either side of 
the table, i.e., looking across the table, not toward the 
kitchen and not toward the street. 

As Farinelli's men stand, ostensibly obedient, some dive, 
some upend furniture for cover, others go for their weapons. 
One races for the front door. 

Spoleto's Men open fire, even as Bernzy rushes to the edge 
of the dining room, already taking his first shot. 

[N.B.: The sudden, brutish violence of the scene has the 
paradoxical effect of making it feel longer, in the 
inexplicable way a car wreck seems prolonged for the drivers. 
A series of inter-locking cuts -- hand on gun, shells on 
floor, splattering of tablecloth, flare from gun, hand on 
camera, etc. -- extenuates time like a slowed-down nightmare 
in which the dreamer tries to flee something menacing.] 

Bernzy kneels behind the table set against the wall outside 
next to the hallway -- the one he moved earlier. 

Bernzy kicks the time-release camera: it slides out toward 
the side wall, aimed upward at the killers and ticking down. 

The scene is sensational, nearly surreal, with bright lights 
flaring in every direction... spent shells bouncing off the 
ground... food, wine and blood spattering onto the white 
table-cloths. 

Bernzy stands for his second shot as The Assassin opens fire 
on Farinelli's bodyguard, who has managed to pull his gun. 
Then he spots Bernzy. Bernzy's camera is aimed at the Assassin 
even as the Assassin turns to kill him. Brazenly, Bernzy 
continues to shoot. 

Through Bernzy's viewfinder, we see what he's seeing: his 
own murder. 

Just before the Assassin pulls the trigger, one of Farinelli's 
Men, who has managed to pull his gun, shoots him. 

Bernzy, seemingly impervious (or possessed) is already 
advancing the film. 

Bernzy is only partly hidden by the table and its overhanging 
cloth: his feet show, he must stand half-erect every time he 
takes a picture. We feel is protected not by the table as 
much as by his single-mindedness: he is an appendage of the 
camera. 

A bullet tears into the lip or leg of the table Bernzy uses 
for cover. There is a violent shudder. He is not sure, and 
we are not sure, if he has been hit by a bullet, or stung by 
the table itself. He just keeps shooting pictures. 

By now there is a horrible litter of wood, cloth, food, blood 
and corpses on the floor. 

ON the time-release camera, next to a corpse: it is stuck, 
at five seconds, as it was at Bernzy's apartment. 

The Lead Assassin gives the signal. The shooting ends as 
abruptly as it began. Farinelli and all his men are dead. 

They leave by the front door. But the last Gunman to leave 
looks curiously over his shoulder, as if he thinks he saw 
something. Then he hurries off, to catch up with the others. 

EXT. STREET 

The Assassins' car is parked in the street. The last Gunman 
approaches it but still seems dissatisfied. Sirens are heard, 
growing closer. 

INT. DINING ROOM 

Bernzy rises unsteadily to his feet. He winces, but whether 
he is wounded, or merely reacting to the devastation around 
him, we still don't know. He cocks his ear as he judges how 
far off the sirens are, i.e., how much time does he have. 

He begins to take pictures of the massacre's aftermath. 

Hearing someone crunch over glass, he looks up. 

The curious Gunman has returned. As the sirens draw nearer, 
the Gunman raises a pistol. 

A distinctive noise is heard from the side of the room: ki- 
ki-ki-ki-ki-click. 

The Gunman swings around, thinking it is one of Farinelli's 
men, wounded but not dead. As he fires into a corpse -- 

Bernzy makes a run for the back hallway. 

The Gunman whirls around again, to fire at Bernzy, but 
Bernzy's gone. 

As the sirens draw very close now, the Gunman flees by the 
front door. 

EXT. STREET 

A police car rounds the corner -- 

EXT. STREET 

Low Angle, on the running board of the getaway car, as the 
curious gunman jumps into the car, even as it squeals away. 

STREET 

The police car screeches to a stop in front of d'Angelo's. 

INT. DINING ROOM 

Bernzy has re-entered. He kneels down to get the time-release 
camera. We see a GUN aimed at him, at the end of an arm. 

VOICE (O.S.) 
Hold it! 

Bernzy looks up. It's O'Brien, the cop. 

O'Brien puts down the gun when he sees Bernzy's face. 

O'BRIEN 
Jesus, Bernzy. 
(he looks around the 
room; he's horrified) 
What the hell is this? 

Bernzy snatches up his camera, starts to move toward the 
back exit. 

O'BRIEN 
Where you goin'? What the hell's 
goin' on here? 

Berzny keeps moving, then turns and runs. 

CUT TO: 

INT. NABLER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Nabler, asleep by the radio (which plays an opera), is aroused 
by somebody pressing his doorbuzzer, frantically. 

INT. HALLWAY 

Nabler opens the door. 

BERNZY 
C'mon, Arty. Now. 

CUT TO: 

INT. ELEVATOR - NABLER'S BLDG. 

Bernzy and Nabler ride down. Nabler's pulling on his coat. 
Bernzy is unloading the time-release camera, shielding it 
from the light within the ample folds of his oversized jacket. 

NABLER 
What if Spoleto finds you? 

BERNZY 
He's finished the second you get 
these to the papers. 

He caps the film in a can and gives it to Nabler. 

BERNZY 
I'll get arrested first, with any 
luck. 

Now Bernzy reachs into his pants pocket to get out a roll of 
film already in a can. When he does so, his coat swings open. 

NABLER 
Jesus, Bernzy: You're bleeding. 

Indeed, a spreading stain of blood soaks Bernzy's shirt on 
the right side of his torso. 

Bernzy presses the roll of film on Nabler. 

BERNZY 
Take those to the Mirror, The Post, 
The Telegraph, The News, Life Magazine -- 

NABLER 
I know the routine. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. NABLER'S BLDG. - NIGHT 

As Bernzy and Nabler come out of the building they see Two 
police cars -- one astride and one nose-to-nose with Bernzy's 
sedan. The Policemen are on the street. 

The eldest of them approaches Bernzy, gently pulls Bernzy's 
hands behind his back, and cuffs him: like every other cop 
in New York, he knows Bernzy. 

POLICEMAN 
Sorry, Bernzy. 

He is led toward a police car. 

NABLER 
F'r God's sakes, he's bleeding! 

BERNZY 
(as he disappears 
into the squad car) 
Go, Arty. Now! 

Nabler hails a cab. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. FEDERAL BLDG. (CHURCH STREET) - NIGHT 

Bernzy is led up the steep stairs. 

INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 

Bernzy sits at a table in a large conference room. The table 
is packed with law enforcement personnel, mostly in suits. 
Some of them we recognize: Chadwick, the FBI agent; Chadwick's 
superior, the Older Agent; Conklin, the homicide detective. 

Various men are smoking and various ashtrays are filled. 
Somebody's yawning. Time has passed. 

CHADWICK 
(to a D.A.) 
Read him the statues about with- 
holding evidence again. 

Bernzy is beginning to look weak. 

BERNZY 
I told you, I had no evidence. 

CHADWICK 
Then how'd you happen to be there? 

BERNZY 
How am I anywhere? I'm psychic. 

One of the Cops smiles. 

The Older agent, seeing it, is incensed. 

OLDER AGENT 
You're out of your league here, Mr. 
Bernstein. The police may take this 
lightly but I'll be goddamned if the 
Bureau's gonna let a picture peddler 
create a scandal in the O.P.A. that's 
gonna undermine morale and hurt the 
war effort. 

Bernzy removes a blood-soaked handkerchief from his side, 
crumples it up. 

BERNZY 
(groggy but annoyed) 
I didn't create the damn scandal. 

CONKLIN 
(tossing him a fresh 
handkerchief) 
Just tell us where the pictures are, 
Bernzy. Nobody here's enjoying this. 

BERNZY 
(looking at the Older 
Agent) 
I'm not so sure. 

OLDER AGENT 
Put him in jail. 

CONKLIN 
Sir, he's bleeding. 

OLDER AGENT 
Put him in jail! 

As two uniformed Cops go to Bernzy's chair, an officiously 
swift WOMAN enters and whispers in the Older Agent's ear. 

OLDER AGENT 
Hold it... The Chief of Police is 
coming in. 

The CHIEF OF POLICE enters, carrying a stack of newspapers. 
A Young Cop in a suit follows him, carrying a larger stack 
of newspapers. 

The Feds stay put, but the police personnel all rise in 
recognition of his rank. 

CHIEF 
Stay down. 

The Chief and his Assistant deal the newspapers onto the big 
table. 

As they hit the table, and various people seize them eagerly, 
we cut from tabloid cover to tabloid cover. 

All of them carry full size front page photos of the shooting. 
The pictures are grainy, owing to the infra-red film, but 
this gives them an even more nightmarish aspect. 

The rigidly set faces of the killers are plainly visible. 
The bullets flaring from the gun barrels are seen like streaks 
of light. 

One tabloid shows a mesmerizing shot of the murdered Assassin 
staring straight at the camera, when he had a bead on Bernzy. 
Others show the staggered, falling, or crumpled bodies of 
the victims. 

At least two tabloid have the fortuitous shot (taken by the 
late-functioning timer camera) of the Curious Gunman shooting 
Bernzy: the Gunman is in the foreground, with his back to 
us, his shooting arm extended, his hand and gun plainly 
visible; Bernzy is in the background as he waits for the 
trigger to be pulled. 

The double-bold headlines read as follows: GAS WAR!!!!! 
SHUTTERBUG SHOOTS MOB SHOOTERS POISON GAS! PHOTOS SHOW: THEY 
KILL THEIR OWN SHUTTERBUG SEZ: "I DID IT FOR G.I. JOE!" MOBFIA 
AT WAR! 

The shot with Bernzy in it is headlined -- THE GREAT BERNZINI! 

Another tabloid splits the page between two photos -- Thatcher 
White -- HE SOLD OUT G.I. JOE -- and Bernzy -- HE SAVED HIM! 

Finally, we see a copy of the New York Times, without a 
photograph, and with a non-bold headline over a discreet 
column below: PHOTOGRAPHER'S PICTURES SAID TO DEPICT BLACK 
MARKET CONFLICT -- Ex-Governor White Implicated In Rationing 
Scandal. 

Meantime, the Chief of Police speaks. 

CHIEF 
According to the Times you're going 
to be lauded on the floor of the 
Senate tomorrow. Senator Watkins 
will officially thank you for saving 
the lives of American servicemen... 
How'd you manage to get the shot of 
yourself? 

BERNZY 
Timer. 

CHIEF 
Right... I have an advance copy of 
Walter Winchell's Sunday night 
broadcast, lead item. 
(reading) 
'Good Evening, Mr. & Mrs. America, 
etc. Tonight a tip of the hat to one 
Leon Bernstein, better known as The 
Great Bernzini. Many's the night 
your reporter has seen Bernzy, the 
s'posedly sorcerous shutterbug at 
Hanson's all-night drug-store -- one 
face among many of New York's silent 
army of dedicated newspapermen...' 

As they Chief reads, we pan the faces around the table. The 
reactions range from amusement (among the cops) to 
consternation (among the Feds) to outrage (the Older Agent). 

CHIEF 
'But Friday night, Bernzy proved 
himself a great photographer, a great 
New Yorker, and a great American. 
His first ever photos of the Mobfia 
at war nips in the bud what was 
potentially one of the foulest 
scandals in American history. Two 
nights ago, only a select few knew 
the meaning of the phrase "Black 
Gas." Now, thanks to Bernzy, we all 
know, and we all cry out against 
this shameless profiteering. Thank 
you, Bernzy, for saving the lives of 
countless American's Over There. 
Thank you on behalf of this reporter, 
all Gotham, and all America.' 

The Chief looks up from the page, to Bernzy. 

Bernzy, clinging to the blood-soaked handkerchief, has passed 
out. 

CHIEF 
Get him to the hospital. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. FEDERAL BLDG. - NIGHT 

As Bernzy, conscious but weak from his loss of blood, is led 
down the stairs outside the Federal Building, propped up by 
two cops, it is he who is now in the public eye. 

He is surrounded by a mob of reporters and photographers, 
shouting questions and popping flashbulbs frenetically. 

REPORTERS/PHOTOGRAPHERS 
How'd you know about it, Bernzy/ 
Bernzy, give us a shot!/Why'd you do 
it, Bernzy?/Bernzy, over here!/ Give 
us something, Bernzy!/Mr. 
Bernstein!/Bernzy!! 

Bernzy smiles as he is led down the stairs, a peculiar, 
blissed out, half-delirious smile. He is half-delirious from 
his blood loss, the frenzied atmosphere, the incessant flashes 
of light. 

Bernzy's POV: The Reporters scream, the flashbulbs pop 
blindingly, until there is such a frenetic burst of bulbs, 
the screen is bleached white. 

The WHITE SCREEN holds for some seconds, and then we 

FADE IN: 

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 

Bernzy, hat in hand, enters a hospital room with flowers in 
it, and soft light. He approaches the bed, where Kay lies, 
holding in her arms a new-born Infant. 

A rather stern Nurse in metal-framed glasses waits to take 
the child back to the nursery. 

KAY 
H'lo, Bernzy. 

Almost shyly, he approaches the bed, smiling at the child. 
He sits on the edge of the bed, takes the child's hand. 

BERNZY 
She looks just like you. Thank God. 

Kay smiles. But then she's crying. Bernzy nods to the nurse, 
who takes away the child. 

BERNZY 
What is it? What's wrong? 

KAY 
I was so lost... so lost. 

He strokes her face. 

BERNZY 
Forget about it. It's all over... 
Talk about lost. I used to think it 
was like a rule. Once you gave 
yourself over to something different, 
something other, somethin' normal 
people turned their backs on, you 
lost your chance to be normal. To be 
human. Just to be human. 

As we hold on him, staring into space, thinking, we hear 
Kay, trying to get his attention, to break his reverie. 

KAY 
Bernzy?... Bernzy! 

CUT TO: 

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

Bernzy's position and Kay's are reversed, i.e.: he's the one 
in the hospital bed, she sits over him, trying to get his 
attention. 

This hospital room -- the real one -- is harshly lit; there 
are no flowers. Bernzy is hooked up to an I.V., attached, at 
the other end, to a dripping bottle. 

The same stern Nurse stands over the bed. 

KAY 
Bernzy? 

As Bernzy comes to he sees Kay, her face close to his, 
speaking quietly. He seems utterly disoriented -- not ready 
to leave his dream. 

Kay looks to the Nurse who nods and goes out. 

KAY 
The bullet went in and out. You lost 
two pints of blood before they brought 
you in, lousy bastards. 

Kay smiles sweetly, but Bernzy is cold and unresponsive. 

He stares at her face. She wonders what's wrong with him. 

KAY 
Bernzy? You okay? 

BERNZY 
(a beat) 
You made a deal with Spoleto... You 
told him about Sal and me so I 
wouldn't get the pictures. 

She looks at him. 

BERNZY 
What'd he give you? He got the Black 
Gas and he gave you the club in 
exchange for no pictures? 

KAY 
He said he wouldn't hurt you, that 
was part of it, too. 

Bernzy knew it was true but didn't want to believe it. 

KAY 
Bernzy? 

BERNZY 
Why'd you do it? 

KAY 
I was afraid you'd get hurt -- 

BERNZY 
Answer me. 

KAY 
(a beat) 
I couldn't take the chance of losing 
the club. It's like you with your 
pictures. You'd do anything for your 
pictures, right? 

She wants him to absolve her. 

KAY 
(a beat; quietly) 
...Please say yes. 

BERNZY 
...Right... 

Bernzy turns his face away from her, to the wall. 

KAY 
Bernzy? 

BERNZY 
Why didn't you just ask me not to 
take the damn pictures? 

KAY 
Nothing would've stopped you from 
getting those pictures. You're a 
fanatic. 

BERNZY 
You'd be surprised what I'd of done 
for you. 

KAY 
(in pain) 
Then you should thank me. You got 
your pictures. Now you're gonna be 
rich and famous. 

BERNZY 
(dryly) 
Thanks, Kay. 

A beat. He can't look at her. 

KAY 
When did you know? 

BERNZY 
The minute I heard Sal was dead. Why 
else would Spoleto take the chance 
of killing him just before the big 
event?... So, you see: I knew goin' 
in, Kay. You don't have t'feel guilty. 
I didn't do it for you... I did f'r 
me. 

KAY 
I wanted you to do it for me. 

He won't look at her; he can't. 

KAY 
If just once you'd said to me, 'I'm 
doing it for you, Kay,' I never would 
of called him. 

BERNZY 
You really figure I'm a complete 
sucker, even now. 

KAY 
I kept trying to get you to say it. 
I tried so hard. How many times did 
I ask? 

We hold on him, his face to the wall. He doesn't want to 
believe it. It's too painful. 

KAY 
Everything they say about me is true, 
I guess. If I loved Lou at all it 
was for what he could give me, I 
don't mean just money. And everything 
they say about you, too: you'd run 
over your grandmother to get the 
right picture. But this was different. 
It was different, Bernzy. You didn't 
know there were gonna be any pictures 
when you started to help me. And for 
once I was talking to someone who 
didn't want a better seat, or an 
introduction. You didn't know enough 
to bribe the maitre d' -- much less 
judge me. The night we sat there and 
had a drink I knew they were all 
watching. I knew they were whispering. 
For once I didn't give a damn. You 
sat there in your lousy suit and you 
were the only one who wasn't a climber 
or a schemer or a snob, and for once 
I didn't feel like one, either... 
(she touches him) 
This was different, Bernzy. Wasn't 
it? 
(vulnerable; she needs 
to know its true) 
Wasn't it, Bernzy?... 

Bernzy, facing the wall, closes his eyes, the pain is so 
great. 

BERNZY 
Why'd didn't you ask me, Kay? Why 
didn't you just ask. 

KAY 
The same reason you couldn't tell 
me, I guess. 

She gets up and goes to the door. 

KAY 
Please don't hate me too much. 

She goes out the door. He stares at the wall, speaks quietly 
to himself. 

BERNZY 
I wish I could. 

He closes his eyes to hold back the pain. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 

VERY CLOSE ON a Middle-Aged Woman who shouts almost 
ecstatically, her mouth rimmed with too much red lipstick. 

WOMAN 
It's him! 

Around her, a kind of pandemonium breaks loose. 

As Bernzy, with Nabler on one side of him and Hayward, the 
Ivy League, alcoholic reporter on the other, comes out the 
door, The crowd -- as big as a mob -- presses in. There are 
dozens upon dozens of Reporters and Photographers. The 
Reporters shout for Bernzy's attention and the Photographers 
take a never-ending series of flash shots. 

Autograph seekers thrust tabloid covers and pens at Bernzy, 
or autograph books, or copies of Life Magazine. Grinning 
Teenagers and Mothers of G.I.'s just want to touch him. 

Bernzy, in his street clothes and ostensibly recovered, is 
emotionally muted, without his usual quick eyes, purposeful 
movements, rapid steps. He offers an occasional wave, or a 
tepid smile, but he seems totally overwhelmed. 

As they descend the crowded stairs, a 60ish, well-dressed, 
Man in the crowd is more or less pulled into their immediate 
orbit by Nabler. 

Nabler shouts; he has to. 

NABLER 
Bernzy, meet my publisher, the eminent 
Albert Gerard. 

GERARD 
Mr. Bernstein, I've followed your 
work for years -- 

NABLER 
(cutting off the 
bullshit) 
He says if I write an intro for your 
book -- what's it called? -- 

BERNZY 
(looking out at the 
crowd) 
'The Public Eye' -- 

POLICEMEN (B.G.) 
Hiya, Bernzy!/Congratulations! 

Bernzy smiles at them as they pass -- but the smile is 
fleeting. 

NABLER 
With an Arthur Nabler introduction 
for 'Public Eye' he'll guarantee a 
double-sized first printing. 
(to Gerard) 
What was the advance you mentioned? 

Gerard quotes the figure as they pass through a particularly 
loud section of the crowd, a particular dense thicket of 
flash-bulbs. 

NABLER 
(smiling, never missing 
a beat) 
Smile everybody, Time Magazine. 

Bernzy moves along automatically, buffeted along by the crowd: 
people extend their hands, poke their smiling faces in front 
of him. 

NABLER 
So -- can we agree to this deal in 
principle. 

GERARD 
We have the greatest enthusiasm. 

BERNZY 
Right. 

GERARD 
Are you okay? 

BERNZY 
Don't like to have my picture took. 

NABLER 
Mr. Gerard's on the Board at the 
Modern Museum. He says there's real 
interest there, as well. 

GERARD 
I have to keep mum on the matter -- 
conflict of interest -- but there's 
more than enough support already. 

BERNZY 
Right. 

GERARD 
(to Nabler) 
Is he okay? 

NABLER 
It's this crowd... We'll speak to 
you tomorrow, Albert. 
(he steers Bernzy 
through the crowd) 
Car's over there. 

As Bernzy continues to be photographed, and shouted at, to 
have autograph books and tabloid covers thrust at him by 
people with pens and pencils, he and Nabler and Hayward make 
their way to the curb, where Bernzy's sedan is parked. 

Nabler gives Hayward the car keys. 

As they get in the car, the crowd presses in: they're 
desperate to make contact with Bernzy. 

NABLER 
(to Bernzy) 
This'll blow over before your 
bandages're off. 

Bernzy and Nabler get in back; Hayward takes the wheel, turns 
back to Bernzy. 

HAYWARD 
You allowed to drink? 

NABLER 
He can have a short one. I asked 
inside. 

When Hayward starts the car, the police radio crackles to 
life. 

HAYWARD 
It's your town, Bernzy: what'll it 
be? Cafe Society? 

Even in Bernzy's distracted state, this is like a slap in 
the face. 

BERNZY 
Huh? 

Nabler takes him by the shoulders and speaks to him, low and 
intent. 

NABLER 
Goddamit, Bernzy: let it go. This is 
what you've been waiting for your 
whole life. Whatever it took, it's 
worth it. 

BERNZY 
Let it go? 

Somebody pounds on the window. 

NABLER 
Let it go. 

BERNZY 
How do you do that? 

NABLER 
I don't know. Nobody does. Welcome 
to the real world. You're just like 
everybody else now. Only you're gonna 
get fawned over by a lot of jerks 
when our book gets published. 

BERNZY 
(a beat) 
It's my book. I'm writin' the 
introduction. 

NABLER 
(secretly pleased) 
Fine... 
(turning to Hayward) 
Let's go to the Stork Club. 

Hayward begins to ease the car away from the curb, but it's 
hard with the mob outside. 

He points to the police radio, crackling, an added distraction 
he doesn't need. 

HAYWARD 
How d'you turn this damn thing off. 

He looks for the switch. 

BERNZY 
You can't. 

HAYWARD 
Huh? 

BERNZY 
You can't turn it off. 

HAYWARD 
Here's the switch, right here. 

BERNZY 
I said you can't turn it off! 

HAYWARD 
Like I say: it's your town, Bernzy. 

He puts the car in gear. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

When we cut outside it is to black and white. We don't hear 
the mob: we hear the police short-wave hissing. 

As Photographers run alongside the car to poke their cameras 
at the windows, as teenagers chase after the car, as the 
grim-faced Policemen try to guide the car through the morass 
of humanity, as an Older Woman begins to cry, it is a series 
of Bernzy-like tableaux, the silent images filled in only 
with the hiss of the radio. 

The car gets free of the crowd and continues up the street. 
We crane up to watch it, as it disappears into the New York 
night. 

FADE OUT: 

THE END
