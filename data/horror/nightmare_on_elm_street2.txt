	EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - DAY

	A big, yellow SCHOOL BUS pulls up to a corner and discharges a 
	group of TEENAGERS.  It's one of those fantastic spring afternoons 
	and the kids take to their freedom like they were just sprung from 
	Leavenworth.

						KIDS
			G'night, Joe...Have a good weekend, etc.

	The BUS DRIVER doesn't answer but nods and smiles as they deboard.  
	He is a pleasant looking elderly man, wearing a khaki work shirt, 
	a matching cap and chewing on an unlit, twenty-five cent stogie.

	The DOORS fold shut, the GEARS GRIND and the bus continues along 
	its route.

	INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

	While there are only about a dozen kids on the bus, the noise 
	level is deafening.  GIRLS are yapping, GUYS are horsing around, 
	someone is fiddling with a ghetto-blaster, trying to decide among 
	several loud stations.

	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

	The bus turns a corner, taking them out of the development and 
	past some older, less identical looking residences spaced more 
	widely apart.

	INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

	The Driver downshifts the old heap, pulls the wheel over to the 
	curb and reaches over to push the door lever open.

	KIDS file out down he aisle, some of them wishing him well as they 
	leave.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as the gears grind again and the bus pulls away.  We see that 
	there are only a few KIDS remaining:  TWO GIRLS sit together 
	toward the center and a lone, nerdy-looking BOY sits at the rear.

	The DRIVER is in front of an aluminum divider and, except for the 
	top of his cap, cannot be seen.

	END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

	ON THE THREE KIDS

	The two girls are pretty, teen-fashionable and just a little 
	immature.  One of them turns back to look over her shoulder.

	CLOSER ANGLE - THE BOY

	Poor kid.  About 17, four-eyes, bad skin, lousy posture and an 
	obvious inferiority complex.  He's sweating profussely and he 
	stands slightly to unlatch and lower the window.  He pulls down on 
	it with all his strength but it is hopelessly stuck.

	He sits back down and sighs.  Suddenly, he feels the girl's stare.  
	he doesn't turn but sends his eyes over to see who's goggling at 
	him.

	ON GIRLS - JESSE'S POV

	The first girl turns back to her friend to whisper something.  The 
	friend turns around to see for herself.

	INT. BUS

	The boy stares forward now and catches her glance directly.

	The girls shift quickly in their seats to face forard and let out 
	with an uncontrollable rush of mean giggles.

	The boy is clearly embarrassed now and looks down at the books in 
	his lap.

	We hear the engine REVVING - the bus seems to be picking up speed.

	One of the girls stands, ready to get off.

	GIRL'S POV OUT WINDOW: EXT. STREET

	A MOTHER, her PRE-SCHOOL CHILD on a TRICYCLE and their DOG wait 
	for the bus to discharge the girl.

	EXT. STREET

	The bus speeds past the waiting group, to their amazement.

	INT. BUS

	The standind girl's jaw drops open as they shoot by a familiar 
	looking intersection and continue to pick up speed.

						FIRST GIRL
					(to her friend)
			Hey!
					(calling to driver)
			Hey, that war our stop!

	The bus turns a sharp corner and the first girl almost falls.  The 
	second girl grips onto the seatback and lifts herself to her feet.

						SECOND GIRL
					(calling to the driver)
			Hey, Joe!  Our stop!

	HER POV - THE FRONT OF THE BUS

	The unseen driver ignores the calls and continues picking up 
	speed.  We might notice that his hat has changed; in place of the 
	cap, we can see the top of a BATTERED OLD FEDORA.

						SECOND GIRL (O.C.)
			Hey, let us off!

	EXT. TWO-LANE STREET - DAY

	The sky has suddenly turned; a wave of threatening clouds sweeps 
	overhead and the WIND is churning a planting of roadside weeping 
	willows into a tangled mess of yellow tendrils.

	The bus WHINES near the top end of third, all of its FLASHERS are 
	going like the dashboard was having a major coronary.  It passes 
	the last house and heads into open terrain.

	IN THE BUS

	THE SECOND GIRL steps into the aisle and starts making her way 
	toward the front of the coach.

						SECOND GIRL
					(under her breath)
			Deaf old fart...

	She stops suddenly and GASPS as she watches

	THE DRIVER'S ARM

	emerge to throw the floorshift into fourth.  His hand is clad in a 
	strange GLOVE that tip his fingers with a menacing set of RAZOR-
	SHARP, STEEL TALONS.  His sleeve is charred and smoking.

	The bus SWERVES WILDLY as it skids around a corner, throwing its 
	few passengers into collision courses with the walls and each 
	other.

	A FLASH OF LIGHTNING crashes through the air.

	EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE

	As the lightning subsides, the sky is dark.  The BUS SCREAMS 
	along, banging through rocks and ditches, CRASHING through a wall 
	of overgrown brambles.  Thick clouds of steam pour out from under 
	he hood and stream back along toward the rear of the vehicle.

	ON THE BOY

	holding o to his seatback and watching out the window in terror as 
	trees TEAR loose from the ground i the bus'wake.

	We hear a LOUD RUMBLING and the bus begins to shake as if the 
	planet itself is splitting in two.

	ON THE BUS

	Skidding across the desert landscape, being THROWN to and fro 
	laterally, at the mercy of the shuddering landscape.

	ON A FRONT WHEEL

	as the tire smacks into a jagged boulder, SNAPPING the wheel from 
	its axle.

	ON THE FRONT END

	BOUNCING to a violent halt, the bumer digging a long trench into 
	the earth.

	IN THE BUS

	THE KIDS pick themselves up from the floor.  It is very hot and 
	smoky inside.  They have moved closer together now, sweating, 
	scared. Frantically, the boy tries to open a window, but it will 
	not budge.

	He looks out the window and gasps.

	EXT. POV FROM WINDOW

	THE GROUND below begins to SPLIT apart and tumble into a deep 
	fissure that is encirling the bus.

	ON THE MOOR, THE BUS CENTER

	The land is IMPLODING all around it; huge chunks of the earth's 
	crust are shearing themselves loose from the edges of the fissure 
	and tumbling into oblivion.

	In moments, the bus is stranded on the narrow tip of a towering 
	ridge of crumbling stone.

	The bus teeters precariously, tasting the smoky abyss in every 
	direction.

	INSIDE

	THE SECOND GIRL is on al fours in the aisle.  She looks up toward 
	the driver's seat.

						SECOND GIRL
					(seeing something
					 hideous)
			Jesus!

	She scrambles to her feet and begins backing off.  The floor of 
	the bus shifts dangerously, throwing the girl into the edge of one 
	of the seats.

	ON THE DRIVER

	as he makes his way toward the back.  We don'g see his face but he 
	is dressed in a filthy green and red sweater.  In the B.G., the 
	dashboard instruments are sparking and sending thick black fumes 
	toward the ceiling.  SMOKE is rising off his body as if he just 
	stepped out of some horrible fire.  A small patch of skin on his 
	hand sizzles and pops and drips a molten glob of flesh that burns 
	a small hole in a seat cushion.

	His Razor-Talons sweep along the tops of the seat-backs CUTTING 
	deep gashes into the green vinyl upholstery and SCRAPING horribly 
	over the tubular steel support poles.

	ON THE BOY

	Terrified.  Lookign first at the awful talons, then out the window 
	at the DEADLY DROP and back at the bus driver.

	ON THE GIRLS

	Sweating, panicking.  They back away, going from window to window, 
	trying desperately to pull them down.  They're all locked tight.  
	One reaches for the emergence door leer at the rear of the bus.  
	It comes off in her hand.

	The kids huddle together, petrified, screaming, as the driver is 
	upon her.

	CU: DRIVER

	He lifts the awful, talonned glove in f.g.  Behind, obscured by 
	smoke, we see, for an instant, his fce -- the face of FREDDY.  he 
	raises his weapon arm higher and STRIKES.

									     SMASH CUT TO:

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

	CLOSE on a steel blade cutting into red flesh.  We PULL BACK and 
	see that it is MOM, slicing a tomato at the kitchen counter.

	This is an all-American family; along with a MOM, there's a DAD 
	and a kid sister named NGELA and they ll are having breakfast 
	together.

	A moment later, there is a muffled, OFF-CAMERA SCREAM.  Mom looks 
	up.  We can also make out the RINGING of an alarm clock in another 
	part of the house.

	ANGELA jumps slightly at the scream.  She's a pretty little 
	eleven-year old, genuinely cute, not precocious.

						ANGELA
					(to Mom)
			Why can't Jesse wake up like every-
			body else?

						MOM
					(hushed)
			Shhh.  He must've had another night-
			mare.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - MORNING

	ON JESSE'S BED. An alarm clock RINGS LOUDLY.

	JESSE WALSH (17) is sitting up in bed.  He's sweaty and scared and 
	disoriented as he slams his hand down on the alarm and tries to 
	shake the nightmare out of his head.

	We see that he's the boy on the bus only he's not half-bad looking 
	- far from nerdy.  he has no skin problems and he doesn't wear 
	glasses and his body's in good shape.

	As he gets out of bed, still shaky from the dream, and we see that 
	his bedroom is littered with cardboard cartons - most of them open 
	and half-empty.  He trips over a carton on his way to his jeans.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

	Mom is at the stove cooking eggs for her family.  She looks up, 
	worried, as Jesse comes in and heads for the refrigerator.

						JESSE
					(mumbles)
			'Morning.

						MOM
					(putting on a smile)
			'Morning, honey.

	Jesse pours himself a GLASS OF MILK from the fridge.  He joins Dad 
	and Angela family at the breakfast table.

						DAD
			You got your room straightened out
			yet?

						JESSE
					(yawns)
			It's getting there.

						DAD
			We've only been living here six weeks
			now.  I want that room unpacked by
			tonight.

	MOM comes over with some eggs for Dad.

						MOM
					(to Jesse)
			Want some eggs...Angela, what are you
			doing?

	ON ANGELA

	She is struggling to put her hand deep into a box of FU-MAN CHEWS 
	breakfast cereal.

						ANGELA
					(frustrated)
			I'm trying to get the Fu-Man Fingers!

	Printed on the box is a cartoon caricature of the Oriental doctor 
	pointing to a bowl of his product with one of his long, sharp 
	fingernails.  there's a burst above the product name that reads:  
	"FREE INSIDE - FU-MAN FINGERS" and shows a drawing of a hand 
	wearing several extra-long, red plastic fingernails on its 
	fingertips.

	Mom lets Angela go o with her search and turns back to Jesse, 
	waiting for his answer.

						MOM
			Jess?

						JESSE
			Huh?

						MOM
			Eggs?

	Jesse rubs his temples.  He was away for a minute but he's back 
	now.

						JESSE
			Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.

						MOM
			You okay?

	Dad eyes him suspicously.

						JESSE
			Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot 
			upstairs.

						MOM
					(nods)
			I know it's warm...
					(to Dad)
			I wish you'd call someone to check out
			the air conditioning, Ken.

						DAD
					(defensively)
			I know what's wrong with the air
			coditioning - just needs a shot of 
			freon, is all.

						JESSE
			Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit
			the deck!

						DAD
			Don't be a smart ass.

	A short silence as they all look back to their plates.

						MOM
					(to Jesse)
			So, school going alright?

						JESSE
					(shrugs)
			Okay, I guess.

						MOM
			Making friends?

	Jesse is looking around for some escape - this interrogation is 
	getting a little too personal.

						JESSE
			Yeah, you know how it is...

	ON ANGELA

	She grabs onto the prize at the botto of the box and gives a yank.  
	A bagful of Fu Man Fingers come out in her hand along with half 
	the box of cereal.

	SOUND OVER:  DOORBELL RINGING

	Mom turns to answer the door, but Jesse immediately jumps up and 
	cuts her off.

						JESSE
			That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.

						DAD
					(calling after him)
			Who's Lisa?

	But Jesse is gone; just a kitchen door, swinging in his wake.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

	as JESSE opens the front door to LISA POLETTI (17).  She is facing 
	the street and she turns around when she hears the door open.  Not 
	a knock-out but real pretty, with an intelligence and sweetness 
	about her -- she is truly lovely.

						LISA
			Hi.

	She smiles and Jesse's eyes light up.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - DAY

	They walk to JESSE'S CAR - a beat-up, blue Falcon parked curbside.

						JESSE
					(gratefully)
			your timing was perfect - I was 
			getting the third degree in there.

						LISA
			How come?

						JESSE
			Ah, nothing.

	Jesse opens Lisa's car door for her.  She steps in and sits down.

	IN THE CAR

	The interior is worse than the body.  The upholstery is torn to 
	shreds, the dashboard is cracked and peeling and there's a big 
	hole where the radio used to be.  A cheap, A.M. transistor radio 
	hangs by its wrist strap from the rear-view mirror.

	Jesse hops in and shifts around to get comfortable, and reaches 
	under the dash to pull out a couple of bare wires.

	Lisa watches him routinely twist the wires together, amused.

						LISA
			Aren't you afraid somebody could
			steal your car like that?

						JESSE
					(preposterously)
			Look at this car.  Are you kidding?

	He sits up again and reaches for a toggle switch that has been 
	crudely drilled into the dash.  He flicks the switch.

	Jesse moves his finger to another alien button in the dash and 
	pushes it.  The STARTER turns over slowly, the engine BACKFIRES 
	and the car starts noisily.

	Jesse gives her the "thumbs up" as if he were a World War I Ace 
	and puts the car into gear.  It BUCKS and FARTS and rumbles up the 
	street.

	EXT. POOL - REAR, WALSH HOUSE - DAY

	DAD floats on a FOAM CHAIR in the middle of the rather run-down 
	pool, sipping coffee from a MUG bearing the word "DAD".  He looks 
	over his domain with satisfaction and inhales a deep breath of 
	fresh, suburban sir.

	MOM comes out the back door.  She looks just a bit worried.

						MOM
			Ken, shouldn't you be getting to the
			office?  It's almost nine.

						KEN
			As soon as i finish my coffee.  I'm
			enjoying my pool right now.
					(sips his coffee)
			I love our new house.  Don't you?

						MOM
					(sighs heavily)
			Of course I do, Ken.

						KEN
			What's the problem, Shirl?

						MOM
					(pointing behind her)
			It's just I'll be a lot happier when 
			you finish taking down those bars.

	CAMERA PANS UP AND ZOOMS IN to reveal BARS ON THE UPPER WINDOWS -- 
	this is the old Thompson house, replete with the security 
	paraphernalia that kept Nancy Thompson prisoner five years prior.

						MOM (O.C.)
			People that lived here before must
			have been truly paranoid.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	Establishing shot of school, shot from parking lot with JESSE'S 
	CAR in f.g.  School is in session, so the only students we see are 
	TWO CLASS-CUTTERS leaning against a car passing a JOINT.

	EXT. HIGHT SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

	An intramural SOFTBALL GAME is in progress.  COACH SCHNEIDER, a 
	nasty looking ex-Marine, stands behind home plate as an umpire.

	JESSE is covering second base.

	RONNY GRADY, a tough-looking wise-ass type, steps up to the plate.  
	He knocks the mud off his sneakers with his bat and takes his 
	stance.

	ON JESSE

	He glances over to the adjacent field.

	HIS POV

	The GIRLS are in the middle of archery instruction.

	LISA is there, mighty tempting looking in her little, powder blue 
	gym suit, a quiver strapped to her shoulder and a longbow in her 
	hand.

	KERRY, a dizzy, Bloomingdale's-punk, steps up alongside Lisa as 
	the latter catches Jesse's stare.

						SCHNEIDER (O.C.)
			Strike!

						KERRY
					(to Lisa, re Jesse)
			He made any moves yet?

	Lisa smiles and waves to Jesse.

						LISA
					(aside to Kerry)
			I only know him a few weeks, Kerry.

	ON JESSE

	He waves back.

	BACK TO LISA AND KERRY

						KERRY
			I think he needs a push start.

	Lisa turns to face the target, slides an arrow into the nocking 
	point, draws back the bowstring and lets the arrow go.

	ON THE TARGET

	It's a bull's-eye.

	CRACK!

	GRADY gets hold of a perfect pitch and sends it flying over the 
	head of the PITCHER.

	BACK TO JESSE

	BOOM!

	The ball skids off the side of his head and the kid collapses. 

	HIS TEAMMATES rush to his side and help Jesse to his feet.  He's 
	more embarrassed than hurt and he waves away any over-attention.  
	COACH SHNEIDER joins the circle of bodies around him.

						SCHNEIDER
			You okay?

						JESSE
			Yeah, I'm fine.

						SCHNEIDER
					(walking away)
			Well, pay attention, next time!

	Jesse re-takes his position on the base.

						GRADY (O.C.)
			Maybe you oughta try something a little
			more your speed, Walsh.  Like knitting.

	Jesse just now realizes that it was Grady who scored a double off 
	his skull.  He's standing just off the bag, harassing Jesse while 
	waiting to be hit home.

						JESSE
					(flipping him the bird)
			Knit this, Grady.

	GRADY sneers and gives him the "JACK-OFF" sign.

	JESSE tosses an "ITALIAN SALUTE", slapping one hand into the crook 
	of his arm and throwing up "THE FINGER" for good measure.

	GRADY grabs his own crotch and points to it obscenely.

	ON THE PITCHER

	He sends one over the plate, the BATTER catches it dead-center and 
	POUNDS it back to left field.
 
	GRADY makes a break for third, only to be forced back by teh LEFT 
	FIELDER tossing the ball to the THIRD BASEMAN.

	ON JESSE

	His glove up to receive the throw as Grady STEAMS towards him.

	The ball snaps into Jesse's mitt and Grady turns on his ankles to 
	shoot back to third.

	Jesse and the third baseman toss the ball between, each time 
	moving closer in toward Grady.  Grady switches directions with the 
	ball, trapped between them.

	GRADY dives into a HEAD-FIRST SLIDE, trying to sneak past Jesse.

	JESSE swoops down and tags him out.

	Thorougly aggravated, Grady rises to his feet by reaching out and 
	grabbing onto Jesse's gym shorts and yanking them down to his 
	ankles, revealing jesse's bare buns-in-a-jockstrap to the world.

	JESSE lunges for Grady, trips over his shorts and the two of them 
	begin rolling around in the dirt, duking it out.

	ON THE GIRLS IN THE NEXT FIELD

	watching the wrestling match with ausement.

	ON LISA AND KERRY

	Lisa tries like hell to repress some laughter.

						KERRY
			Cut ass.

	ON SCNEIDER

	pushing his way through a crowd of laughing, cheering SPECTATORS 
	and jumping in to break up the scuffle.

	He lifts both boys up by their necks.

						SCHNEIDER
			Okay boys, assume the position!

	INT. COACH'S OFFICE - DAY

	Schneider is at his desk.  TWO BOYS carrying gym bags pass outside 
	the Coach's office.  They wave to him through the WIRE-GLASS 
	WINDOWS.

						BOYS
			'Night Coach.

	Schneider gives them a cold glance.

	He checks his watch, gets up and goes to a window to look outside.

	HIS POV - THE PRACTICE FIELD

	JESSE and GRADY, side by side in the center of the baseball 
	diamond.  They are in "front-leaning rest" position, the cruel and 
	painful frozen pushup that ends halfway to the ground with elbows 
	bent.

	We don't know how long they've been out there but it's probably 
	hours.  It seems just a little darker out and a lonely wind is 
	blowing around their arms and legs.

	In the B.G., KIDS are filing out of the building - some sop to 
	look out at the two boys, point and snicker.

	ANGLE:

	We see LISA among the kids.  She stops for a moment and views the 
	scene with concern.

	ON JESSE AND GRADY

	They are dirty, their shirts are ripped and Jesse has a tiny 
	bruise over his cheek.

	And they're tired too.  The muscles in their arms are twitching 
	convulsively and they talk to each other between groans and 
	through teeth clenched with pain.

	We hear the OFF-CAMERA SOUND of several busses pulling out.

						JESSE
			How much longer you figure he'll keep
			us out here?

						GRADY
			Could be all night.
					(nodding in the Coach's
					 direction)
			Guy gets his rocks off like this.
			Hangs out in queer S & M joints
			downtown.  Likes prettyboys like
			you.

						JESSE
			Get outa here.

	Grady doesn't pursue it.  Instead, he looks around and tries to 
	think of some small-talk.

						GRADY
					(finally)
			So, what about you and that Poletti
			girl?

						JESSE
			What about it?

						GRADY
			You two got a thing going, or what?

						JESSE
			She's a neighbor, I drive her to
			school.

						GRADY
			She giving you any carfare for the 
			ride?

						JESSE
			You got a problem with me, Grady?

						GRADY
					(shrugs)
			Naw. Just killing time.

	SOUND OVER:  A WHISTLE BLOWING

	ON THE COACH

	Dressed in his street clothes, crossing the field toward the 
	faculty parking lot.  He pulls the whistle from his mouth.

						SCHNEIDER
					(to the boys)
			Okay boys, hit the showers.

	INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

	JESSE and GRADY stand at opposite ends of a row of lockers and 
	change into their street clothes.  Their movements are slow and 
	cumbersome - like a pair of creaky old men.

						GRADY
					(finally)
			So, you live around here.

						JESSE
					(sighs wearily)
			Not too far.  My folks bought a place
			over on Elm Street.

	Grady stops buttoning his shirt and looks up at Jesse.

						GRADY
			Elm Street?  You telling me you moved
			in to that big white house with the
			bars on the windows?

						JESSE
			Yeah, why?

	Grady shakes his head and tucks his shirtails in.

						GRADY
			Shit, you can tell your old man he's 
			a real chump.

						JESSE
			What the hell are you talking about?

						GRADY
			They've only been trying to unload 
			that dump for five years.  That 
			place is bad news.  Some chick was
			locked in there by her mother and
			she went crazy.  She watched her 
			boyfriend get butchered by some 
			maniac in the house across the street.  
			Her poor drunken momma took her own
			life right inside your front door.

	Jesse stares dubiously at Grady.

						JESSE
					(with a nervous laugh)
			You're full of shit.

	Jesse pulls his knapsack from the locker shelf, slams the door 
	shut and walks away.

	ON GRADY

	He smiles mischievously and shuts his own locker door.

	EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

	JESSE'S CAR is parked among a handful of others.  LISA leans 
	against the front fender, waithing patiently.

	HER POV

	JESSE steps out of the building and spots her.  he hurries across 
	the lot.

	ON LISA

	as Jesse approaches.

						JESSE
					(surprised to see her)
			Hi!  You didn't have to wait.

						LISA
			That's okay, I wanted to.

	He raises an eyebrow as he opens the door for her.  He likes that.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Jesse slides in beside her and STARTS the engine.

	She looks him over.  He looks like he's been through the mill a 
	couple of times.

						LISA
			You okay?

						JESSE
			Yeah, yeah, sure.

						LISA
			Let me look at your eye...

	Jesse lifts his chin to show off the tiny bruise over his 
	cheekbone.  He looks almost a little proud of it - like it's an 
	old war wound.  Lisa touches it tenderly.

						LISA
			You shouldn't be fighting with that
			jerk.

						JESSE
			Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's 
			just a hothead.

						LISA
			You mean a shithead.

						JESSE
					(laughs)
			Yeah.

	He guns the engine and they pull away.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT

	It's very late.  The house is dark and even the crickets have hit 
	the sack.

	INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	JESSE's having trouble sleeping.  He turns over on different sides 
	and punches up his pillow a couple of times, stares into space and 
	finally sits up.

	He gets out of bed, pulls on a pair of pants and exits.

	KITCHEN

	He enters.  The room is lit only by the glow of a three quarter 
	moon.

	He regains his composure and steps over to the sink to pull off an 
	absurd length of paper toweling.

	We see it just when Jesse does;  a GROTESQUE FACE has been peering 
	into the window all this time.  It disappears from view on Jesse's 
	DOUBLE TAKE.

	Jesse stops for a moment to slow down his heart.  He takes a deep 
	breath and steps up to the back door.

	He opens the door.

	EXT. SIDE OF WALSH HOUSE - NIGHT

	Jesse opens the gate and enters.  It is really quiet; not even 
	night-sounds.

	He strains to see past the shrubbery that surrounds the house.

						JESSE
					(hoarse whisper)
			Grady?

	He looks around.

						JESSE
			It better be you, you son of a bitch!

	We hear an awful sound from somewhere - WOOD RIPPIGNG.

	Jesse makes his way cautiously along the side of the house.

	He notices a red-orange LIGHT is flickering from behind a cellar 
	window.  He gets down on his hands and knees to investigate.

	THE CELLAR - HIS POV

	An INTRUDER is bent over by the furnace, lit only by a raging fire 
	in the fire-box.  He puts his hand right into the flames and 
	begins digging for something way in the back of the furnace.  We 
	can't see his face but he is dressed in a filthy green and red 
	striped sweater and a battered hat.

	He pulls out a bundle of rags, sets it on top of the furnace and 
	proceeds to unwrap it.

	ON JESSE

						JESSE
					(petrified)
			Holy shit...

	He stands up and looks around frantically.  He doesn't know what 
	to do.

						JESSE
					(near tears)
			Holy shit...

	He hurries out the gate that leads to the front of the house.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - NIGHT

	Jesse enters the house and scans the foyer.  He heads toward the	 
	cellar door.  It is ajar -- the LOCKHAS BEEN SPLINTERED AS IF BY A 
	HUGE WRECKING BAR -- and we can hear the ROAR of the furnace from 
	below.

	He sticks his head inside the cellar door and peeks down.

	HIS POV

	The SHADOW OF A FIGURE; movement on the cellar walls.

	ON JESSE

	Breathing heavily.  Brain whirring.

	SLAM!

	He pulls the basement door closed and holds it shut tight, 
	practically hyper-ventilating.

						JESSE
					(screaming)
			Dad!

	He looks around frantically.

						JESSE
			DAD!

	Something inside starts to pull the cellar door open.  Jesse tries 
	to hold it shut, but the inexorable force continues to inch it 
	open.

	Jesse lets go and bolts toward the foyer.  FREDDY is standing in 
	his path, a sick smile on his scarred face.  He flashes his razor-
	knives at Jesse.

						FREDDY
					(sinisterly)
			Daddy can't help you now.

	Jesse tries to make a break for it but Freddy is too fast.  His 
	un-taloned hand gets an iron grip on Jesse's shirt collar.

						FREDDY
			I've been waiting five years for you,
			Jesse.  We got special work to do, you
			and me.  Things are really gonna heat
			up.

	Jesse struggles to get free.  Freddy tightens his iron grip and 
	fans his talons threateningly.  Jesse's head stretches back from 
	the chocking pain.

						FREDDY
			We'll do real good together, you and
			me.

	Freddy hurls Jesse against the wall.

						FREDDY
			You got the body...
					(doffs his hat)
			I got the brains.

	With that, Freddy removes his hat.  There is no skull under there 
	- just a pulsating mass of blody BRAIN MATTER.

	JESSE lets out an agonized SCREAM.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	ON JESSE, still in bed but his entire body arched backwards over 
	the mattress.  His scream continues until he collapses back down 
	into the sheets.

	ON HIS DOOR

	It flies open and DAD crashes into the room, followed by MOM.  
	They go to his bedside and stare at him as he pants and coughs his 
	way back to consciousness.

						MOM
					(to Dad)
			Maybe we should call a doctor.

						JESSE
			No.  I'm okay.

	He sits up to prove it.

						JESSE
			Really.  Just a bad dream.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - DAY

	A rather bored looking group of STUDENTS is listening with little 
	interest to the droning of their teacher, MR ABLE, who is 
	lecturing them from the front of the room.

						MR. ABLE
			So, to review, the solid waste, those
			nutrients that are not absorbed in the
			lining of the stomach, the large 
			intestine, the small intestine - the
			alimentary canal - are passed out 
			through the colon...

	SOUND OVER:  A FAKE FART

	LAUGHTER from the class.

	ABLE looks up crossly from his notes until the laughs trail off.

						MR. ABLE (O.C.)
					(continues)
			The liquid nutrients are then carried
			through an elaborate system of filtering,
			aided by the pancreas, liver and gall
			bladder...

	TWO GIRLS at the back of the room look at each other.  One puts 
	her finger in her mouth and pretends to gag.

	As Able DRONES on in the B.G., we're

	ON JESSE

	He's having a hell of a time keeping his eyes open.  His head bobs 
	intermittently as he starts to nod out.

	ON GRADY

	He nudges a CLASSMATE at the next desk to look over toward Jesse.  
	They snicker.

	ON JESSE, THEIR POV

	nodding out

	BACK TO ABLE

						MR. ABLE
			Or collected in the bladder to be expelled
			at a later time.  And this entire process
			is kept moving through "the circulatory
			system", the center of which is...
					(a beat)
			...the heart.

	On the beat, he reaches under his lab table and plunks a BLOODY 
	CALF'S HEART down right in the center of it.

	We hear DISGUSTED GROANS from the class.

						MR. ABLE
			...Four chambers, just like the human
			heart, really.

	Able describes the path by sticking his index finger into each 
	orifice.

						MR ABLE
			From the body, through the right auricle,
			to the right ventricle and out the 
			pulmonary artery to the lungs.

	BACK TO JESSE, ASLEEP

	A particularly ugly and ferocious looking SNAKE is wrapping itself 
	around his arm, making its way toward Jesse's face.

	CLOSE ON JESSE

	As he wakes up slowly and looks down groggily toward his arm.

	THE SNAKE

	opens wide and emitsa long demonic hiss.

	Jesse screams and hastily begins pulling the reptile away from 
	him.

	ON ABLE

	Standing next to Jesse, he pulls the snake off his arm and drops 
	it into a nearby tank.

						MR. ABLE
			If you want to play with animals, Mr.
			Walsh, join the circus.

	GUFFAWS from the class.

	JESSE looks around, bewildered and embarrassed.

	He spots GRADY, grinning widely.

	INT. THE WALSH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

	Comfortable and very suburban.  A major color T.V. takes up the 
	wall opposite a pair of His and Hers Barcaloungers.

	DAD is watching The Six O'clock News on the tube and fanning 
	himself with a T.V. Guide.

	MOM sits on the couch with ANGELA, helping her with a jigsaw 
	puzzle.

	TWO PARAKEETS are fluttering around inside a cage near the entry 
	into the dining room.

	JESSE bounces down the stairway, a rolled towel tucked under his 
	arm.

	DAD stares at him angrily then turns back to the game.

	JESSE CROSSES in front of the set on his way out of the room.

						DAD
			Where are you going?

						JESSE
			Just out for a while.

						DAD
					(shaking his head)
			I told you I want that room unpacked.

						JESSE
					(begging)
			Oh, come on Dad...

						DAD
			No.
					(pointing toward the
					 stairway)
			Upstairs.

	Jesse's about to protest but Dad cuts him off.

						DAD
					(firmly)
			Now.

	Jesse turns around, mumbles something under his breath and stomps 
	back upstairs.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE -EARLY EVENING

	A pair of glass sliders lead from the house onto a stretch of 
	patio that surrounds a gorgeous built-in swimming pool.  The patio 
	is dotted with all the amenities of backyard recreation: a gas 
	bar-b-que grill, a wet-bar, plenty of pipe furniture and even a 
	pair of free-standing cabanas.  The entire set-up is contained by 
	a six-foot, chain link security fence.

	LISA steps out of the cabana, wearing a swim suit.  She tosses her 
	towel onto a nearby chair and crosses to the diving board.

	ON THE BOARD

	She bounces lightly and jumps off, cutting gracefully through the 
	water and coming up in the center of the pool.

	MRS. POLETTI, a pleasant looking woman in her late 40's, slides 
	open the patio doors and pokes her head out.

						MRS. POLETTI
					(calling)
			There's a Jesse on the phone.

						LISA (O.C.)
			Okay...thanks.

	LISA swims to the edge of the pool and hoists herself up.  She 
	throws the towel over her shoulders and picks up a wireless phone 
	from a low table.

						LISA
			Jesse, hi...
					(a beat, diappointed)
			Oh...that's okay.  Sorry you can't
			make it.
					(a beat)
			No, I understand.  Parents can be
			real pains...I'll see you in the 
			morning, then...

	She hangs up and frowns.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	JESSE stands at the foot of the bed, surveying the job unhappily 
	and trying to figure out where to start.

	Finally, he pulls a SHOE BOX from inside a larger carton, places 
	it on his desk and lifts the lid.

	It's full of cassette tapes.  He rifles through them, selecting 
	one and popping it inot a PORTABLE CASSETTE PLAYER on the desk.

	He pushes the "play" button.  The tape is ROCK AND ROLL.

	The music gets him moving a bit.  He surveys the room, then goes 
	to A CARTON NEAR THE BOOKSHELVES.  He reaches deep into the near-
	empty carton and pulls out a stack of books which he plops on the 
	shelves next to other books already unpacked.  He tosses the 
	carton aside.

	He's getting into the music now as he spins around to face the 
	bureau.  He opens a SMALL POX on the bureau while be-bopping along 
	and pulls out a PAIR OF SUNGLASSES which he puts on, practically 
	dancing.  He dumps the contents of the box haphazardly into a 
	bureau drawer.

	JESSE opens a large bureau drawer.  He grbs a nearby box and dumps 
	it into the large drawer, smoothing it over perfunctorily with his 
	hands.  A Stetson cowboy hat is on top.  He drops it on his head 
	and pulls it down low over his eyes.

	ON A FULL LENGTH MIRROR

	Jesse steps into frame to get a look at himself.  He likes what he 
	sees as he mimes a guitar riff along with the music.

	In one smooth move, in rhythm with the music, he seings around and 
	moves to the desk.  He dumps a SMALL BOX OF PENCILS AND SUPPLIES 
	into the desk drawer.  As an afterthought, he grabs a couple of 
	pencils out of the drawer and drums a few beats on the desk with 
	them.

	He shoves the pencils up his nostrils, tucks his thumbs under his 
	armpits and waves his elbows like he's doing the "Funky Chicken".  
	Silly stuff that one owuld only do behind closed doors.

	He spins around, throwing his arms out and stopping ddead in his 
	tracks.

	HIS POV

	LISA and MOM are standing in his doorway.  Mom looks horrified.  
	Lisa represses a giggle.

	Mom reaches over and knocks timidly on the open door.

	Jesse hastily pulls the pencils out of his nose and dives for the 
	stereo to turn it off.  Beet-red, he tosses the hat and sun 
	glasses onto the bed and tries to look nonchalant.

						JESSE
					(embarrassed)
			Hi.

	Jesse looks to Mom who takes the hint and turns to leave.  Lisa 
	takes a step into the room.

						LISA
					(when Mom is out of
					 range)
			I told her you invited me over.  I
			guess I should have called, huh?

	Behind the embarrassment, he's glad to see her.  He puts the 
	pencils in the desk drawer and shuts it.

						JESSE
			No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.

						LISA
			I know.

	Lisa casually steps over to a carton and peeks in.

						LISA
			I figured you might like some help.

						JESSE
					(pleasantly surprised)
			Yeah?

	JESSE'S ROOM - LATER

	The room is shaping up nicely with only a few boxes remaining.

	Jesse pulls a bundle wrapped in newspapers from a carton.  He 
	tears away the paper, revealing a baseball trophy.

	He places it on a conspicuous corner of his dresser.

	Lisa reaches into the box, retrieves an aerosol can and looks at 
	it.

	ON THE CAN

	A medicated spray for JOCK ITCH.

						LISA (O.C.)
			Where does this go?

	JESSE grabs the can from her hand and puts it down on the dresser 
	behind the trophy.

						JESSE
					(mortified)
			There's a box of sweaters over there 
			if you want to put them up in the 
			closet.

	Lisa is anxious to pitch in.  She nods good-naturedly and steps 
	over to her assignment.

										     CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE CLOSET

	As Lisa opens the door and pulls an overhead chain to switch on 
	the light.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as she drags a chair over, lifts a pile of sweaters from an open 
	box, steps up on the chair and stacks them on a shelf.  She starts 
	to step back down when something catches her attention in  the 
	back corner of the shelf.

	She reaches in and pulls out a small, red leatherbound book.

						LISA
			What's this?

	Jesse steps over to look at it.

	ON THE BOOK

	about two-thirds the size of an average paperback, it has a 
	matching leather thong that snaps into a small latch on the front 
	and opens the book.

						LISA
					(reading)
			"Nancy Thompson, 1428 Elm..."
					(looking up at him)
			Hey, this thing is five years old.

	Jesse steps over and looks over her shoulder.

						JESSE
			You know her?

						LISA
					(shaking her head)
			Uh-uh.  Before my time.

	She turns a few pages.

						LISA
					(reading)
			"February 17th - My birtday.  Daddy 	
			came by today with a big ol' stuffed 
			bear for me.  He took me to dinner 
			and a movie and when we got back, he 
			and Mother had another one of their 
			fights.  He left angry.  I wish they
			would stop fighting..."

	Jesse waves the diary away, uninterested.  He crosses back to 
	continue unpacking.

						LISA
			I think it's sad...

						JESSE
					(cynically)
			Traumas of a ten-year old.

	Lisa leafs through a few more pages, stops and begins reading with 
	widening eyes.  She glances at Jesse and smiles impishly.

						LISA
					(reading)
			"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep 
			with him again.  I can't yet - I 
			like him, I want to make him happy 
			but I'm not sure that I love him.  
			I can't sleep with someone I don't 
			love."

						JESSE
			That's typical.  I hope she didn't
			expect to make the best seller list 
			with this thing.

	Lisa ignores him and scans the page.

						LISA
					(finding something)
			Wow, listen to this!
					(reading)
			"Sometimes, when I'm lying here in 
			bed, I can see Glen, in his window
			across the way, getting ready for
			bed.  His body is slim and smooth
			and I know I shouldn't watch but
			that part of me that wants him
			forces me to.  That's when I
			weaken.  That's when I want to go
			to him..."

	Jesse is suddenly interested.  He walks over and Lisa hands him 
	the diary with the page open to that entry.

	He reads it and quickly turns the page.  He frowns and turns 
	another, then another.

						JESSE
			That's it?
					(another couple of
					 pages)
			Wait, she skipped a week.
					(reading)
			"March 15 - he comes to me at night.
			Horrible.  Ugly.  Dirty.  Under the
			sheets with me, tearing at my night-
			gown with his steel claw..."

	Jesse's voice trails off on "claw" and a chill of vague 
	recognition goes through him.  He checks the cover of te book and 
	flips back a few pages.

	Lisa moves closer to read over his shoulder.

	Jesse composes himself and looks back at the book.

						JESSE
					(reading)
			"His name is Fred and he keeps taking
			me to the boiler room.  He wants to
			kill me."

	Jesse almost shivers.  He turns the page, and he freezes.

						LISA
			What is it?

	ON THE DIARY

	Jesse shows her the page.  There is one sentence scrawled across 
	the next entry.  Lisa reads it.

						LISA
			"Tina is dead."

	ON JESSE AND LISA

	They look at each other, spooked.  He turns the page.

						JESSE
					(reading)
			"Rod's been killed - he got Rod.
			Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall
			asleep!"

						LISA
			Wow...

	Jesse's face turns ashen as he looks up at Lisa.

						LISA
			Are you okay.

						JESSE
					(nodding; covering)
			Something Grady told me today about
			the people that lived here last. 
			Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend
			killed in the house across the 
			street...

	He is interrupted by Mom, poking her head into the room.

						MOM
					(cheerfully)
			How's it going?

	Jesse instinctively hides the diary behind his back.

						JESSE
			Okay...

	She looks over the room, impressed at the progress.

						MOM
			Looks great!  Thought you might want
			to take a break - got some cold cider
			downstairs.

	Jesse looks at Lisa to see what she wants to do.

	Lisa looks over at Jese's alarm clock.  THe time is 8 P.M.

						LISA
					(standing up)
			No...thanks.  I better get back.
					(to Jesse)
			Got a major paper due the end of this
			week.

						MOM
					(ducking back out)
			Well, it's there if you change your 
			mind.

	Jesse waits for her to leave.

						JESSE
					(to Lisa)
			Are you sure?

						LISA
					(nods sourly)
			World History.
					(brightening)
			But, I'll see you in the morning, right?

	Jesse nods.

						LISA
					(pointing to the diary)
			Hot stuff.  Let me know how it turns
			out.

	Jesse opens the door for her.

						JESSE
			I'll walk you downstairs.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	MOM wraps the night-cover over the BIRD CAGE.  She steps past 
	ANGELA on the couch and crosses in front of DAD, in his recliver, 
	vegetating in front of the tube.  SHe sits and loosens her collar 
	a bit.

	ON DAD

	He shifts uncomfortably and wipes some beaded sweat from his upper 
	lip.

						MOM
					(to Dad)
			A little warm in here, huh?

	Dad gets up from his chair.  His shirt is sticky with 
	perspiration.

	Jesse steps in from the dining room, a glass of milk in his hand.

	ON ANGELA

	looking up at Jesse.  She puts a finger to her lips.

						ANGELA
			Shhh...The birds are sleeping.

	Jesse notices the intense heat in the room immediately.  His eyes 
	widen portentiously.

	ON DAD

	at the thermostat.

						DAD
					(astounded)
			It's 97 degrees in here!

	He pulls off the coverplate and starts fiddling with the coil.

	Suddenly, a LOUD SQUAWK from the other side of the room makes 
	everyone look up.

	Jesse puts his milk down on he T.V. and hurries over to the cage, 
	ripping the cover away.

	ON THE BIRD CAGE

	Another series of HORRIBLE CRIES as one of the budgies proceeds to 
	rip up the neck of the other one with his sharp beak.

	LONGER ANGLE:

	Jesse throws open the door and tries to pull the attacking bird 
	off his victim.  the vicious one continues the rabid attacks on 
	Jesse's hand, drawing blood.

	As Jesse pulls his arm out, the bird flies out into the living 
	room, roaring a repetitive WAR-CRY that is eerie and unnatural for 
	something that size.

	MOM and DAD jump to their feet.  ANGELA starts screaming at the 
	top of her lungs.

	ON THE BIRD

	It circles around the ceiling and then DIVES for Dad, cutting a 
	deep gash under his eye.  It seems much larger than it was before 
	- maybe twice its original size.

						DAD
					(screaming)
			Get a broom or something!

	ANGLE: LIVING ROOM

	Mom dashes out of the room.

	THE BIRD swoops down, heading for Angela but crashing into the 
	shade of a table lamp, knocking it to the floor.

	It flutters to the ceiling and hovers near a light fixture.  Its 
	beak and most of its head is covered in blood and it opens its 
	mouth to emit a gutteral growl.

	MOM returns with a broom and hands it to Dad.

	As Dad approaches and lifts the broom to his shoulder, the bird 
	screams agai and dives for Jesse.
	
	Jesse throws his arm out to block the attack.  The bird reverses 
	direction and Dad swings in mid-air with the broom.

	He misses, demolishing the remaining table lamp instead.

	ON THE BIRD

	It hovers again in the air, seemingly without any means of 
	support, PUFFING UP, GROWING ANGRIER, MORE DEMONIC.  Then, just as 
	it seems ready for a last lethal attack, there is a loud BANG and 
	the bird literally EXPLODES into FLAMES in mid-air.

	The family looks at one another in horror and disbelief.  The only 
	sound in the room is ANGELA, attached to her mother's leg and 
	whimpering quietly.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	CRASH!

	DAD 	dumps an odd assortment of home handyan tools on the kitchen 
	table.  He picks through them, selecting a pipe wrench and a screw 
	driver.

	He crosses to the stove.  We see Mom in the B.G., standing, not 
	quite cowering, still in shock from the bird attack.

	Jesse is leaning on the counter, next to the range, watching his 
	father's determined moves.

	Dad leans into the appliance and attempts to pull it away from the 
	wall, probably tearing six or seven ligaments in the process.

	After several tries, he stops and looks up at his son.

						DAD
			Help me with this thing!

						JESSE
			It's not the gas, Dad!

						DAD
					(angrily)
			Don't tell me it's not the gas!

	He yanks on the stove with more vehemence.

						DAD
			Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your
			mother thought she smelled gas.

						MOM
					(timidly)
			I wasn't sure, Ken...

						DAD
					(to Mom)
			Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies?
			That cheap seed you've been buying?

						MOM
					(resenting that)
			Oh, please...

						DAD
			What is it then?  There's got to be an
			explanation.  Animals just don't burst
			into flames for no reason!

						JESSE
			Well it sure isn't leaky gas pipes.

	Dad stands up suddenly, CRACKING his head on the edge of the range 
	hood.

						MOM
					(concerned)
			Ken!

	As he groans in pain, he's suddenly hit with a revelation.  He 
	points an accusatory finger at Jesse.

						DAD
			You set this all up, didn't you?  One
			of your sick jokes?

						JESSE
			What are you talking about?

						DAD
			You know what I'm talking about.  What
			did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry
			bomb?

	Jesse is angry now.

						JESSE
			I don't have to listen to this!

	He storms out of the kitchen.

						DAD
			Come back here!

						MOM
					(upset)
			Ken!

	Dad looks blankly at the wrench in his trembling hand.

						DAD
			I don't know...I don't know, Shirl.
			He used to be a good kid.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. JESSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Dark again, sleeping soundly.

	INT. WALSH HOME - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Jesse emerges from his room and eases the door shut as quietly as 
	possible.  He stops to listen for any signs of his parents being 
	awake.

	SOUND OVER: SNORES FROM BEHIND THEIR BEDROOM DOOR

	He steps lightly past their room adn toward the head of the 
	stairs.

	WE FOLLOW Jesse as he descends the stairs into the darkened foyer.

	THE CELLAR DOOR

	Jesse stops there, momentarily losing his nerve.

	He finally turns the knob and opens the door.

	INT. WALSH HOME - CELLAR - NIGHT

	Jesse pulls an overhead chain, flooding the cellar with light.

	It's just as he saw it in his dream but devoid of any intruders.

	he steps up the the furnace, squats down and opens the firebox 
	door.  He reaches in.  To his horror, he feels something and pulls 
	out an object, wrapped in rags.

	ON THE OBJECT

	as he unwraps it.  An old, beat leather glove with a row of rusty 
	knife blades protruding from the fingers.

	Suddenly, the furnace switches on with a ROAR.

	FLAMES are leaping out of the firebox.

						FREDDY (O.C.)
					(laughingly)
			Hot enough for you?

	JESSE reels around.

	FREDDY is just across the room.

						FREDDY
					(re: the glove)
			Go ahead, Jesse.  Try it on for size!

	Jesse looks at the glove.  The blades are no longer rusted but 
	gleaming and sharp.

	he throws the weapon to the floor.  Freddy moves in closer.

						JESSE
			What do you want?

						FREDDY
			I need you to finish my work.  Let me
			teach you, Jesse.  We'll have fun.  
			You like my little trick with the 
			bird?

	Freddy advances.  Jesse steps behind a stack of cartons.

						FREDDY
			Kill for me.
					(laughing)
			c'mon Jesse.  Come to Freddy.

	Jesse pushes over a stack of cartons in his path and dives for the 
	steps.

	Halfway up he misses his footing and slips, tumbling back down.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Jesse comes to at the foot of the cellar steps.  The furnace 
	has stopped and Freddy is gone.  As he gets to his feet, he 
	notices.

	THE GLOVE

	on te floor, where he dropped it as shiny and new as the day it 
	was made.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

	MOM, DAD, and ANGELA are all at the breakfast table, picking at 
	their food; none of them is particularly hungry this morning.

	JESSE enters and heads wordlessly to a coffee pot on the stove.  
	he pours himself a cup and turns abound to face his family.

	Jesse and Dad are making an extra effort to avoid each other's eye 
	contact.

	ON ANGELA

	She's still feeling bad, drawing little circles in a puddle of 
	maple syrup with a corner of her waffle.

						JESSE
					(to Dad, suddenly)
			Why did it take them five years to sell
			this house, Dad?

	Dad shrugs his shoulders uncomfortably.

						DAD
			I don't know.  COuldn't get the right
			price, I suppose.

						JESSE
			And you don't know anything about a 
			murder across the street and a 
			crazy girl who lived here - who 
			saw the whole thing?

	Mom looks at Dad.  This is all news to her.

						DAD
					(testily)
			I don't know.
					(a beat, coming clean)
			They told me something about it, yeah.
			What difference does it make?

	He feels Mom's stare and finally turns to her.

						DAD
			Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think
			we got such a good deal?
					(to Jesse)
			Listen - all old houses have stories.

						JESSE
			Did they tell you she went totally 
			out of her mind - that they had to
			put her away?  And that her mother
			killed herself in our living room?

	ON ANGELA

	She slides up to Mom.

						ANGELA
			Mommy, I'm scared.

						MOM
					(comforting her)
			Shhhhh.  Jesse and Daddy are just
			making believe, sweetheart.
					(to Jesse)
			I don't think we should be talking
			about this now.

	Dad turns back to Jesse.

						DAD
					(indicating Angela)
			You see what you're doing?  Now I
			don't want to hear another word
			about it.  There's nothing wrong 
			with this house!

	ON MOM

	he looks up from Angela and sniffs the air.

						MOM
			Something burning?

	Mom and Dad oth look toward the counter-top.

	THE TOASTER, THEIR POV

	GLOWING RED-HOT and then, not just smokey toast but FLAMES leaping 
	out of the bread slots.

	Mom gasps and Dad jumps to his feet, grabs a dish-towel and begins 
	beating out the fire.

	JESSE turns white as he watches the scene.

	Dad turns white as he watches the scene.

	DAD turns away from the smoldering toaster, tosses the towel aside 
	and heads back toward the table.

						DAD
			Craziest damn thing I ever saw - wasn't
			even plugged in.

	Jesse puts his cut down hard on the counter and walks out.  THe 
	screen door slams behind him.

	Mom looks at Dad, horrified as Anglea clings to ehr side.

	EXT. MC DONALD'S PARKING LOT - DAY

	IN JESSE'S CAR

	As JESSE unrolls the bundle of rags he found the night before and 
	lets the finger knives drop with a CLATTER on the seat between 
	himself and LISA.

	On Lisa's side of the dashboard we see the remnants of a big, 
	fast-food breakfast;  Egg McMuffin, danish, orange juice and 
	coffee.  Jesse nurses a cup of joe as Lisa picks up the glove and 
	examines it with interest.

						LISA
			This is amazing!  Your dream told you
			where this was?

						JESSE
					(nods)
			Only it was more like, you know, sleep-
			walking.  All I know is I woke up on
			the cellar floor next to it.

	He reaches into his knapsack and pulls out the diary.

						JESSE
			Forget about going back to sleep after
			that.  I was up all night.
					(more intense)
			I finished reading this.  It gets real
			crazy towards the end, after all the
			death stuff.  But then she said some-
			thing really freaky - about her mother
			taking her down to the basement to 
			show her the glove.

	ON LISA

	She's totally sucked in to the story, wide-eyes and waiting for 
	more.  She offers a french fry to Jesse.  He shakes his head.  She 
	pops it into her mouth and nods for Jesse to go on.

						JESSE
			That's when she started talking about
			Fred Krueger.

						LISA
			Who?

						JESSE
			Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream 
			who's coming to kill her.  Seems he 
			was a real guy, ten years before who
			went around kidnapping kids and 
			killing them.

	ON LISA

	She emits a long, windy whistle.

	INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

	KIDS are at their lockers, taking off their jackets and getting 
	together everything they'll need for the day.

	ON JESSE AND LISA

	As they walk down the hall together.

						LISA
			Maybe you were having a premonition or
			something.  You know, like those guys
			who help the police solve crimes and 
			find missing people.  You ever had 
			anything like this happen before?

	Jesse thinks about it.

						JESSE
					(finally)
			No. Never.
					(a beat)
			You think that's what it is?

						LISA
					(thoughtfully)
			I don't know.

	They stop in the middle of the corridor.

						LISA
			Can I look at that diary for a little
			while?

	Jesse raises his eyebrows vaguely, reaches in his bag and hands 
	over the book.

						LISA
					(taking it)
			Thanks.

	Before she can go on, they are interrupted by a squeaky voice to 
	their side.  At the sound of it, Lisa displays annoyed 
	recognition.

						KERRY (O.C.)
			Hi, guys.

	LONGER ANGLE:

						LISA
			Hi, Kerry.

						KERRY
					(to Lisa)
			I got your invitation yesterday.  
			Thanks.
					(a beat)
			Any cute guys gonna be there?

						LISA
					(tired sigh)
			All of them.

						KERRY
			Yor dad picking the music again?

						LISA
					(smiles)
			Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.

	Jesse looks at Lisa quizzically.

						LISA
					(to Jesse)
			Last party I had, Dad insisted on 
			playing nothing but Benny Goodman
			records all night.

	The class bell RINGS.

	Lisa leans over and kisses Jesse.

						LISA
			I'll see you later, okay?

	The kiss takes him by surprise as she walks off with Kerry.

						JESSE
					(calling after her)
			I may be late.  Baseball practice!

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

	The school TEAM has been split up into two sides.  There's an air 
	of excitement about - like it's a close game, drawing to an end.

	GRADY is on third, waiting to be hit home.

	The PITCHER winds and throws.

	ON THE BATTER

	A swing and a miss.  SCHNEIDER calls him out.

	He tosses the bat aside, disgustedly.

	JESSE is on deck.  As he approaches the plate:

						A TEAMATE (O.C.)
			Last out.  Up to you, Walsh.

	ON GRADY

	He sneers like they might as well just concede the game now and go 
	home early.

	The PITCHER sends one right down the middle.

	JESSE lets it go and Schneider calls a strike.

	He chokes up a bit on the bat and takes his stance.

	Another perfect pitch and Jesse lets it go again.

						SCHNEIDER
			Strike!

	Grady slaps himself in the face and shakes his head pitifully.

	The PITCHER throws another.

	This time, Jese catches it perfectly, SLAMMING it down the middle 
	for a solid hit.

	GRADY scores amid cheers and slaps on the back.  JESSE holds up at 
	first.

	INT. BOY'S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

	JESSE is at the end of a row of lockers.  He pulls off his shirt 
	and tosses it in the locker, takes down a towel and sets it down 
	on the bench next to him.

	Several BOYS pass by on their way to their lockers or the showers, 
	giving Jesse the thumbs-up.

						BOYS
			Good game, Walsh...Way to go, Walsh
			...etc.

	GRADY approaches and goes to his own locker, down a few from 
	Jesse's.

	Jesse plops down on the bench and slowly pulls off his sneakers.  
	He stops to rub his aching shoulders.

						GRADY
					(finally)
			You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.

						JESSE
			It was okay.

						GRADY
			Who told you to choke up that way?

						JESSE
			My Dad.  He played in the minors for
			a while, when he got out of college.

						GRADY
					(impressed)
			No shit.

	They continue undressing in silence.  As Jesse speaks, COACH 
	SCHNEIDER steps up behind them.

						JESSE
			Schneider shouldn't have called you
			out on that double.

						GRADY
			Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick
			up his ass today.

						JESSE
					(laughs)
			Schneider's always got a stick up
			his ass.

	Schneider smiles wickedly as he places his hands on the two boys' 
	shoulders.

	EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY

	JESSE and GRADY trudge along at somewhere between a job and a 
	stumble.  They talk to each other with words that are punctuated 
	by huffs, puffs and side-stitches.

						JESSE
					(cautiously)
			You remember your dreams, Grady?

						GRADY
			Only the wet ones.

	Jesse shoots him a condescending sneer and decides not to pursue 
	it.

	EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

	The lot is practically empty with most of the students on heir way 
	home by now.  Jesse's car is parked in the center.

	LISA is leaning on the car, waiting with a stack of books at her 
	side.  She looks up as Jesse approaches.

						JESSE
			Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.

						LISA
			I just got here myself.  Went to the
			Public Library.
					(proudly)
			Cut four classes!

	He opens the door for her.  She picks up the books and climbs in.  
	Jesse runs around to the other side and slides in beside her.

						JESSE
					(indicating the books)
			What's all this.

						LISA
			Research.
					(she kisses him)
			Hi.
					(an intriguing wink)
			C'mon, let's go for a ride.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The blue Falcon rolls down the highway.

	INSIDE

	JESSE is driving as LISA re-stacks some of the books on her lap 
	and begins leafing through one.

						LISA
			I'm convinced you've had a genuine
			psychic vision.

	Jesse looks over at her inquisitively.

						LISA
			At first I wasn't sure because you
			said that you never had anyting like 
			last night happen before.  But I 
			found out that most people have the
			potential for tuning in to "the 
			other world" and neve do.  It has
			something to do with the environment 
			- like they have to be in a place 
			that's sending signals.

						JESSE
			Like a haunted house, right?  I don't
			believe in ghosts.

						LISA
			You don't have to.  You just have to
			believe in energy.

	She shifts in her seat to face him.

						LISA
					(intensely)
			Look, you got electricity in your
			body, right?

						JESSE
			Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...

						LISA
			And heat and chemical reactions.
			Where does it all go when you die?

						JESSE
			I don't know - into the air I
			suppose.

						LISA
					(pointing up ahead)
			Make a left at this corner.

	Jesse turns at the intersection.

						LISA
			What about "essential energy" the 
			soul.  Does that go into the air
			too?  You think there's a good 
			energy and a bab energy?

						JESSE
					(confussed)
			I don't know.
					(a beat)
			Where are we going?

						LISA
					(smiles mysteriously)
			It's a surprise.

	EXT. ABANDONED POWER PLANT - DAY

	An old generating plant, big enough to have served what was once a 
	small town but rundown and obsolete now.  the place is charred and 
	the grounds are littered with rubble - as if there'd been a fire 
	there long ago.

	The entrance to the plant is boarded up and plastered with "NO 
	TRESPASSING" signs.  Many of the boards are missing, providing 
	easy access for the scores of vandals who had torn through there 
	at one time or another.

	There are no windows at ground level but the top of the building 
	is lined with many multi-paned frames; all of them are either 
	cracked or missing.

	JESSE'S CAR pulls into frame and he and LISA get out and look the 
	place over.

						JESSE
			What is this place?

						LISA
					(excidedly)
			Remember in the diary - Nancy said
			that she kept finding herself in 
			a boiler room?  Fred Krueger
			worked here.  It's an old power-
			plant - a steam generator!

	She pulls out several papers and hands them to Jesse.

						LISA
			Here.

						JESSE
			What's this?

	ON THE PAPERS

	Xeroxes of newspaper articles.

	The HEADLINE reads:  "SPRINGWOOD SLASHER ARRESTED!"

						LISA (O.C.)
			I did some reading up on our friend,
			Fred Krueger.

	Jesse leafs through the papers.  Each one is a front page from a 
	local newspaper.

	HEADLINE: "KRUEGER FREED ON TECHNICALITY!  D.A. RESIGNS"

	HEADLINE: "JUSTICE DONE - KRUEGER KILLED BY MOB!  SPRINGWOOD
		     SLASHER DIES IN HELLISH INFERNO"

	Jesse sucks in his breath.

	INT. ENTRANCEWAY, ABANDONED POWERPLANT - DAY

	Jesse and Lisa climb between a pair of boards and step inside.

	ON LISA

	She walks toward the center of the plant, fascinated.

	INT. POWERPLANT

	We can see the remnants of a large boiler room.  Big steel pipes 
	jut out of the floor in a tangle of elbows and valves and a 
	clutter of debris.  A one-story holdig tank rises above a concrete 
	pit and is met on top by a mze of catwalks, just under the 
	windows.

	Although most of the ceiling has burned away, the interior is 
	surprisingly intact for a derelict building and the overhead light 
	distracts form any intrinsic creepiness the place would possess 
	after dark.

	Jesse steps in behind her.

						LISA
					(solemnly)
			He kidnapped twenty kids and brought
			them all here to die.

	She gives herself a chill but shakes it off and turns to Jesse.

						LISA
			So, you feeling anything?

						JESSE
			What do you mean?

						LISA
			I thought you might be able to make
			a connection.

	Jesse shrugs his shoulders and puts his hands to the side of his 
	mouth.

						JESSE
					(calling)
			Any ghosts in here?

						LISA
			C'mon, cut it out.

						JESSE
			Well, what am I supposed to do?

						LISA
			I don't know.  Concentrate or some-
			thing.

	Jesse shifts his legs and stares up at the ceiling.  He closes his 
	eyes.

						JESSE
					(still concentrating)
			I feel like a jerk.

						LISA
			Shhh.  Just concentrate.

	Jesse walks around in a small circle, keeping hsi head up and his 
	eyes closed.

						LISA
			Anything?

						JESSE
					(shakes his head)
			Uh-uh.
					(a beat)
			Wait...

	He walks slowly across the room, almost in a trance, until he 
	comes to a board leaning up against the foot of the mesh-iron 
	stairway that leads up to the catwalks.

	ON THE BOARD

	As his hand reaches over to touch it.

	ON LISA

	stepping over next to Jesse.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	He pulls the board away.

	A LARGE RAT, in her nest, WITH HER YOUNG, SNARLS at him.

	Jesse and Lisa jump into each other's arms.

	EXT. ABANDONED POWERPLANT - LATE AFTERNOON

	JESSE and LISA walk along the outskirts of the building to a 
	pretty cluster of shade trees nearby.  Lisa hoists herself up on a 
	boulder and looks at the building.

						JESSE
			Disappointed?

						LISA
			About what?

						JESSE
			About not finding any bogey men?

						LISA
					(smiles)
			I'll get over it.

	She is disappointed - She wanted to find some bogey men.

	Jesse comes up close to her and they stare at each other.

						LISA
					(finally)
			You are sensitive.  I mean you sensed
			that the rat was there.  And I can
			feel something about you.  Sometimes
			I feel like I know what you're thinking.

	Jesse moves in closer an puts his arms on her shoulders.

						JESSE
					(suggestively)
			Yeah?

						LISA
					(ignoring the 
					 suggestion)
			Maybe it only happens when you're
			sleeping - that's the way it was with
			Nancy, wasn't it?

						JESSE
			Now, there's an idea we can take off 
			on.  Maybe we should drive out to the
			beach tonight and lay out a couple
			of blankets and...
					(winks)
			Until I fall asleep.

						LISA
					(slyly)
			Maybe we can do that.  Strictly 
			scientific, of course.

	Jesse moves in until their lips are almost touching.

						JESSE
			Nancy went bonkers from this thing.
			You wouldn't be afraid of being out
			on the beach with a potential 
			lunatic?

						LISA
			Ghostbusters are fearless.

	They kiss.  Not little friendly pecks like before -- this is the 
	real thing.  Jesse drops his arms to her waist and she opens her 
	legs so that he can get in real close.

	Suddenly, Jesse groans in pain and stands upright, tearing from 
	their embrace.  For the briefest instant, we can see protrusions 
	grow and subside on his forehead and the side of his face.

						LISA
			What is it - What's wrong?

						JESSE
					(holding his stomach)
			Whoa!

						LISA
			What is it?

						JESSE
			I don't know - a sharp pain.

	Lisa watches his helplessly.  Finally, the agony lifts from 
	Jesse's face.  He straightens up.

						JESSE
			It's gone now.

						LISA
			Oh, Jesse...

	Lisa puts her arms around him.

						LISA
			Jesse, this is no good.  You've got
			to get some sleep, Jesse.  You've 
			got to get some sleep.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse is in bed, tossing restlessly adn panting heavily.  He is 
	drenched with sweat and continues to perspire profusely as he sits 
	up and turns on his bedside lamp.

	A thunderhead is RUMBLING somewhere nearby.

	The PLASTIC SHADE OF THE LAMP is melting.

	He scans the room picking out various indications of the intense 
	heat that is surrounding him; A CANDLE on his bookshelf collapses 
	into a puddle of wax, the LAMINATED TOP OF THE NIGHT-TABLE is 
	bubbling, an UNSHEATHED RECORD ALBUM hangs over the corner of the 
	desk, his PORTABLE STEREO has caved in the center - a Daliesque 
	tableau.

	SOUND OVER: SCRAPING

	Jesse gets out of bed, crossing to the desk.  The scraping sound 
	intensifes.

	CLOSE ON THE DRAWER

	as Jesse opens it.  Inside, THE GLOVE, fingers moving, 
	independently, unattached, scraping little cuts in the bottom of 
	the drawer.

	ON JESSE

	slamming the drawer shut.

	SOUND OVER: A SWISHING SOUND, FOLLOWED BY A THUMP, AGAIN AND AGAIN

	UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

	JESSE, barefoot and wearing only a pair of jeans and an unbuttoned 
	shirt, steps up to the door to Angela's room.  The sound is coming 
	from inside.  He opens the door.

	ANGELA is standing in the middle of the floor, in her nightgown, 
	seemingly oblivious to the heat.  She is jumping rope and 
	chanting:

						ANGELA
			One, two, Freddy's coming for you.

	ON JESSE, PETRIFIED

						ANGELA (O.C.)
			Three, four, better lock your door.

	ON ANGELA

	She sees her brother staring at her.  She doesn't stop jumping but 
	smiles and continues her jingle:

						ANGELA
			Five, six, grab your crucifix...

	Jesse SLAMS the door shut.

	KITCHEN

	Jesse enters, looks out the windows.  A huge bolt of LIGHTNING 
	RIPS through the night sky; a multiple flash f blue light strobes 
	through the kitchen followed by a CRACK of intense THUNDER.

	ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHTNING cuts across the kitchen itself, 
	SHATTERING SOME DISHES on the counter-top, leaving a plume of 
	BLACK SMOKE.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

	The rain continues to come down in buckets.  Jesse enters shot and 
	walks, unprotected in his drenched jeans and shirt and seemingly 
	without any knowledge of where he is going.

	The streets are totally empty.

	EXT. DON'S PLACE - NIGHT

	A seedy tavern on a badly lit corner.

	JESSE steps into frame.

	He stares at the place before stepping up to he door.

	INT. DON'S PLACE - NIGHT

	The toughest looking bar in the entire city.  The place is packed 
	with PROSTITUTES, PIMPS, TRAVELING SALESMEN, a couple of 
	TRANSVESTITES and a generous delegation of the leather and chain 
	contingency.

	Jesse enters and crosses to the bar amid a few stares.  He sits on 
	a stool.

	The bartender draws a cold beer and presents it to Jesse.  As the 
	bartender turns away, Jesse reaches for the glass.

	A HAND slaps down on his wrist and holds it tightly.

	He looks up.

	COACH SCHNEIDER is standing over him.  He's wearing a muscle 
	shirt, a gold chain around his neck and he has a sick grin on his 
	face.

	INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

	JESSE is barefoot, jogging arund the outer edge of the gym floor 
	and looking as if he's about to collapse from exhaustion.

	ON SCHNEIDER

	Leaning against a wall of the gym, watching Jesse run.

	As Jesse comes around for another lap, Schneider reaches out and 
	grabs him, throwing him into a wall of folding wooden bleachers.  
	Jesse is dazed, ready to drop.

						SCHNEIDER
					(barking)
			Hit the showers.

	INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse turns on one of the faucets and lets the hot water hit him 
	full on.

	INT. COACH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	SCNEIDER turns to a huge, padlocked cabinet on the wall.

	He unlocks it and opens the doors.  It is filled with a variety of 
	athletic equipment:  dumbbells, jump-ropes and volley balls, etc.

	Schneider selects a pair of jump-ropes from the cabinet and sets 
	them down on his desk.

	A distinct PING makes him look up.  He goes to the door and looks 
	out into the hall.

	SHOWER ROOM

	Jesse continues showering.

	INT. COACH'S OFFICE

	Schneider turns back to his office.  There is ANOTHER PING.

	A TENNIS RACQUET hanging on the wall has two broken strings.  TWO 
	MORE STRINGS SMOKE, THEN SNAP with a ping.

	A BASKETBALL leaps off a shelf of the equipmnt cabinet and bounce 
	on the floor at Schneider's feet.

	Schneider bends down to pick it up and TWO MORE BALLS jump out 
	onto the floor.

	A FOURTH BALL flies out and knocks over a TROPHY on his desk.

	Schneider hits the deck when a DUMBBELL streaks across the office 
	and SLAMS into the window, cracking the thick wired glass.

	ON SCHNEIDER

	he makes his way to the cabinet by crawling along the floor as 
	BASKETBALLS, VOLLEYBALLS, even a MEDICINE BALL fly over his head.

	He reaches up to close the cabinet doors.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	A JUMP-ROPE on the desk unravels like a harpoon line and wraps an 
	end of itself around Schneider's wrist.  The other end pulls hard 
	and yanks Schneider off balance.

	He reaches up to close the cabinet doors.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	A JUMP-ROPE on the desk unravels like a harpoon line and wraps an 
	end of itself around Schneider's wrist.  The other end pulls hard 
	and yanks Schneider off balance.

	As he reaches with his free arm to unwrap his wrist, the SECOND 
	ROPE rockets off the desk top and secures itself to his other 
	wrist.

	hThe office door opens by itself.  The ropes drag Schneider 
	screaming from the room.

	SHOWER ROOM

	JESSE turns as the shower head next to the one he is using, 
	gurgles and suddenly comes on full.  And suddenly, all the showers 
	are on, spewing water and steam.

	We hear Schneider's screams as he is dragged into the room, 
	through great puddles of water and against the tiled wall opposite 
	Jesse.  The showers on this side are OFF.

	The boy watches in horror as the ropes shoot up to two adjacent 
	shower nozzles and hoist the Coach into a helpless spread-eagle, 
	facing the wall.  His clothes shear from his body like sheets of 
	tissue paper.

	A STACK OF TOWELS

	Comes to life, snapping in mid-air at Schneider's butt and back.  
	As they hit him, they draw blood.

	ON JESSE

	as the room fills with great clouds of steam until he is nearly 
	obscured; just a dark human form in the corner of the shower room.

	ANOTHER ANGLE ON SCHNEIDER

	as a figure in a green and red sweater and a battered fedora, cuts 
	through the clouds, CACKLING and throwing his weapon-arm back like 
	a World Series pitcher about to lob a fast ball.

	Schneider screams painfully as the knives cut four long tears in 
	him, starting at the top of his naked back, cutting through his 
	flesh.

	The weapon arm STRIKES AGAIN.  Schneider screams, goes limp.

	WIDE-ANGLE: SCHNEIDER

	BLOOD begins to flow out of all the shower heads on Schneider's 
	side.  Schneider hangs limply from the shower heads.

	ON THE MURDERER

	CAMERA DOLLIES IN FAST to reveal it is JESSE.  He screams.

	Jesse lifts his hand into frame.  He is wearing Freddy's bloodied 
	glove.

						JESSE
			No...Oh God, no...

	He slowly drops to his knees, sloshing in a crimson puddle, and 
	stares up to the heavens.

						JESSE
					(screaming)
			No!!!

									     SMASH CUT TO:

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

	We hear the DOORBELL RINGING repeatedly until the lights flick on 
	and DAD hurries to the door, wrapping a robe over his pajamas.

	HIS POV AS HE OPENS THE DOOR

	TWO POLICEMEN in rain slickers stand on either side of Jesse.  he 
	is naked but is wrapped in a blanket.  His hair is soaked and 
	dripping over his face.

						1st POLICEMAN
			This belong to you?

	Dad can't believe what he's looking at.  He just nods his head.

	The 2nd Policeman gives Jesse a slight push across the threshold.  
	He stumbles into the house.

						1st POLICEMAN
			We found him wandering out on the Highway, 
			naked.  Keep a leash on him, will ya?

										     CUT TO:

	KITCHEN - A TEA KETTLE WHISTLING

	MOM takes the kettle from the stove and pours it into a mug.  She 
	steeps the teabag as she crosses to the table and

	JESSE

	Wide awake, holding the blanket tightly around his neck, takes the 
	cup from his mother.

	DAD paces the floor angrily.

						DAD
			Okay, we're gonna put our cards on the
			table, here and now.  There's not going
			to be any retribution - no fire and 
			brimstone.  I only have two questions
			and you'll answer them and we'll all go
			to bed, okay?

	Jesse nods weakly.

						DAD
			Okay. What are you taking and who are
			you getting it from?

	Jesse snorts and shakes his head ironically.

						JESSE
			I'm not taking drugs, Dad.
					(to Mom)
			Can I go to bed now?

						MOM
					(touches his cheek
					 tenderly)
			Sure...go ahead.

	Dad tries to burn a hole through him with his eyes as Jesse gets 
	up from the table and leaves the room.

	As the double-hinged doors slap clsoed behind him, Dad turns to 
	Mom without a change of expression.

						DAD
					(no question about it)
			He's on something.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - MORNING

	DAD is standing on a ladder, unbolting a set of security bars from 
	the windows.

	He watches from above as JESSE runs out the door, followed by MOM.

						MOM
			Jesse, please, let's talk about this!

						JESSE
					(pleading)
			I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.

	Jesse walks over to his car and climbs in.

	Mom turns to Dad who is watching the scene curiously.

						MOM
			He needs professional help.  I think
			we should take him to a psychiatrist.

						DAD
					(incensed)
			Are you nuts or something?  What
			the hell is that going to do?

						MOM
			I don't know!  I just know he needs
			help and we don't know how to give
			it to him.

	Dad shifts on the ladder and begins to protest.

						MOM
					(squelching it)
			Don't fight me on this.

	She stomps back toward the house.

						DAD
					(calling after her)
			He needs a kick in the but, is what
			he needs.  He needs a methodone 
			clinic!

	She throws back a dirty look.

						MOM
			Oh, blow it out your ass, Ken.

	With that, Dad loses his footing on the ladder and drops down 
	several rungs.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	Jesse's car travels slowly and turns onto a tree-lined street.

	INSIDE

	JESSE drives silently with LISA looking over at him, upset.

						LISA
					(upset)
			Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?

						JESSE
					(staring straight ahead)
			I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.

						LISA
					(undeterred)
			you didn't say more than two words to
			me the whole way here.  You had another
			nightmare, didn't you?

						JESSE
			yeah, I had a bad night.

						LISA
			You want to talk about it?

						JESSE
			My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom
			thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I
			don't agree with her.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	as Jesse's car pulls into the lot.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as they turn a corner.  Jesse jams on the brakes.

	THEIR POV - THE GYMNASIUM WING

	in the distance.  A crowd of STUDENTS is gathered in a ring about 
	three-deep outside the doors leading to the practice fields.

	IN THE CAR

						JESSE
			Oh God.

	He throws open the door, jumps out and runs toward the crowd.

	Bewildered, Lisa does likewise, running after him.

	As they get closer, they can see that the entire area is cordoned 
	of with red plastic ribbons.

	SEVERAL POLICEMEN and OFFICIALS are coming in and out of the 
	building.

	A TEACHER is trying to disperse the students, clapping his hands 
	together and pushing through the rubber-neckers.

						TEACHER
			Okay gang, let's move along.

	Jesse stops at the edge of the barricade cranes his neck to see 
	what's going on.

	GRADY spots Jesse and runs over to his side.  Jesse is turning 
	white as he watches the scene and listens to Grady's recap:

						GRADY
			Holy shit, man.  Where have you been?
			Fuckin' Schneider got wasted last night.

	Jesse swallows hard to regain his composure.  Lisa arrives at his 
	side.

						JESSE
			Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.

						GRADY
					(ignores him)
			He must've been working late and some
			fruitcake came in and sliced him up
			like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left
			bloody footprints all over the...

	Jesse clamps his hand over his mouth and breaks for some bushes 
	against the building.

	Grady looks at a horrified Lisa and gives a puzzled shrug.

	INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

	ON THE FOOD LINE

	LISA and KERRY are on the lunch line, sliding their trays along 
	the rails.  Kerry is wearing a walkman with the volume truned way 
	up - we can almost make out the song.

						KERRY
			That was something this morning, huh?
			About Schneider, I mean.

	Lisa nods and takes a plate of macaroni and cheese from one of the 
	KITCHEN STAFF.  She doesn't want to talk about it.

						KERRY
			Jesse sure took it bad, didn't he?

	Lisa shrugs and moves her tray away from Kerry's, toward the 
	CASHIER.

	Kerry picks up a piece of cake from a shelf and slides ehr tray 
	down until she's next to Lisa again.

	IN THE DINING ROOM

	JESSE is sitting at a table, a tray of food in front of him, 
	untouched.

	He glances up at GRADY as he sits down next to him and starts 
	digging in.


						GRADY
					(with his mouth full)
			Look, I'm sorry about Schneider, man.
			I didn't know you were so close.

	Jesse doesn't qualify that with a response.

						GRADY
			You want to go out to a movie or something
			tonight?  Get your mind off things?

	Jesse shakes his head.

	Lisa comes over to the table with her tray and sits down next to 
	Jesse.

	Kerry follows and sits next to Grady.

						KERRY
			Hi, guys.
					(to Grady, 
					 coquettishly)
			Hi, Ronny.  You going to Lisa's party
			tomorrow night?

						GRADY
					(without looking up
					 from his food)
			I can't.  I'm grounded.

						KERRY	
			How come?

						GRADY
			For throwin' my grandmother down a
			flight of stairs.

	Kerry, taking him seriously, nods gravely.

	Lisa looks at Jesse's tray of untouched food.

						LISA
					(to Jesse)
			You should eat something - you'll feel
			better.

						JESSE
			I'm not hungry.

						LISA
			I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure
			it out, you know.  We can figure it out
			together.

						JESSE
			There's nothing to figure out.

						GRADY
					(to Lisa, disgustedly)
			You're wasting your time, the guy's a
			basket case.

						JESSE
			Shut up, Grady.

	Grady pushes his tray aside.

						GRADY
			You want me to shut up?  Fine, I'll 
			shut up, that's fine.  See you around,
			buddy.

	Grady gets up and storms away from the table.

	Lisa, deeply pained, looks at Jesse.  Jesse avoids her stare until 
	he just drops his head into his hands and tries not to cry in 
	front of his friends.

	He composes himself quickly and digs his fork into his lunch, 
	choking down some macaroni.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	LISA, her MOTHER and FATHER are sitting, eating dinner.  Lisa's 
	mind is not at the table with her.

						MRS. POLETTI
					(to Lisa)
			Bought some nice strawberries at the 
			farm today.  We can have some short
			cake for your friends tomorrow.

	Lisa looks up an dsmiles blandly.

						MRS. POLETTI
			I also wangled a promise out of your
			father.

	ON MR. POLETTI

	He scowls slightly.

						LISA
					(politely)
			What's that?

						MRS. POLETTI
			We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow
			night.

						LISA
			You're going out?

						MRS. POLETTI
			We're going to bed.

	She looks at her husband.

						MRS. POLETTI
			Early.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - NIGHT

	Quiet.  The lights inside are all out.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

	We hear FOOTSTEPS and we TRAVEL with the sound along the floor to 
	the foot of the basement steps.

	INTRUDER'S POV

	as he climbs the steps and approaches the door to the main part of 
	the house.

	THE CAMERA is moving faster now, leaping the top steps and 
	CRASHING through the doorway and onto the foyer floor.

	It crosses the FOYER adn begins climbing the stairs to the bedroom 
	level.  It stops at Angela's room and opens the door.

	ANGELA sleeps soundly, peacefully.

	It crosses over to the bed, a menacing SHADOW creeps over her 
	form.  The taloned glove pulls down on the blankets and she shifts 
	position in the center of the bed, innocent and vulnerable.

	We see the SHADOW of the intruder on the wall...it moves in close 
	to the sleeping child and emits a guttural, inhuman VOICE:

						INTRUDER (O.C.)
			Wake up, little girl...

	Her eyes flutter open.  She looks up at the intruder and smiles.

						ANGELA
					(sleepily)
			What time is it?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	We now see that it's JESSE standing over her.  he's in his 
	underpants, drenched with sweat and hunched over as if all the 
	muscles in his body were twisted around each other.

	The sound of Angela's voice softens him.  He slowly straghtens up 
	and looks about the room as if wondering how he got there.

						JESSE
					(himself again)
			It's late...go back to sleep.

	She nods and closes her eyes.

	Jesse starts to pull the covers back over her and stops suddenly.

	HIS POV

	His right hand is wearing the GLOVE.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The desk lamp and a late movie on the T.V. are the only sources of 
	light in the room.

	We see that the bed is rumpled and empty and we PAN across the 
	room, to JESSE, sitting on the floor in front of the door, knees 
	up against his chest, trying with all his strength to stay awake.  
	He has a mug of black coffee in his hand and a pot of java at his 
	side.

	He tops off his cup and reaches into the breast pocket of his 
	shirt, withdrawing a small vial of pills.

	A BOTTLE OF NO-DOZ

	He rips the cap off with his teeth and dumps half the bottle into 
	his coffee.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - MORNING

	A dark, dreary day.  There are no morning sounds except for the 
	SQUEAKING of an old rattle-trap bicycle as an overweight PAPER BOY 
	swings by and lobs the morning edition over the lawn.

	The paper skids off the front steps and into the garden.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - FOYER - MORNING

	JESSE walks down the steps.  He looks ragged and exhausted and 
	worse that ever.

	OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN

	He stops before going through the double-hinged door to push his 
	hair back and forces a well rested, easy-going guise.

	IN THE KITCHEN

	DAD and ANGELA are sitting at the table.  MOM is pouring some 
	coffee into a couple of cups.

	JESSE enters.

						JESSE
			Morning.

						MOM
			How'd you sleep, honey, okay?

						JESSE
			Fine.

	Mom gives him a quick glance.

						MOM
			You're looking a little better today.

	DAD looks at Jesse's pale skin, the light stubble on his chin and 
	his dark, bloodshot eyes and turns to Mom as if she's nuts.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	The entire pool area has been done up to the max.  Japanese 
	lanterns have been strung up above the fence, a long table, 
	covered with festively arranged salads and condiments, stretches 
	across the patio in front of the sliders and a Benny Goodman dance 
	tune is blaring through some outdoor speakers.  An all-too-bright 
	underwater light makes the blue water shimmer crystal-clear.

	A score of nubile GIRLS in scanty swimsuits and athletic GUYS in 
	cut-offs and trunks, scamper around, eating, swimming and horsing 
	around.

	ON MR. POLETTI

	Standing over the gas grill, wearing a "Kiss the Cook" chefs hat 
	and apron, cooking up a mess of hanburgers and hot dogs.

	ON MRS. POLETTI AND LISA

	stepping out of the house through the sliders, carrying more 
	plates of food outside.

	A BOY

	bounces once on the diving board and CANNONBALLS into the center 
	of the pool, SPLASHING everything within a fifteen foot radius 
	including,

	MR. POLETTI

	who spins around from the grill, annoyed.

						MR. POLETTI
			Hey, watch it there!

	LISA turns to her mother, mortified.

	Mrs. Poletti hands her the platter she is holding and gives Lisa a 
	reassuring squeeze on the shoulder before leaving her side and 
	crossing toward her husband.

	Lisa turns her attention to JESSE, at the far corner of the patio, 
	sitting in a lounger, alone.  He looks worried and detached.

	She looks back toward the grill.

	MRS. POLETTI is pulling her husband away, against his will.  He 
	finally relents and beckons a BOY over.  He turns his spatula over 
	to him, surrenders his chef's hat and allows Lisa's mom to escort 
	him back toward the house.

	JESSE, LISA'S POV

	He finally gets up and crosses toward the cabanas, going inside 
	and shutting the door.

	BACK TO LISA

	as her mother and father approach.

						MRS. POLETTI
			We're going up to bed now.

						LISA
					(gratefully)
			Thanks, Mom.

	Mr. Poletti clearly doesn't like this arrangement.  He looks 
	behind him at all the horny young boys and turns back to Lisa.

						MR. POLETTI
					(sternly)
			Twelve-thiry, Miss.  No later.

						LISA
					(nods agreeably)
			Twelve-thirty.  I promise.

	Mrs. Poletti takes her husband by the arm again and leads him up 
	to the sliders.  He turns around before going through.

						MR. POLETTI
			And don't forget to lock the gate.

						LISA
					(nods)
			Goodnight, Daddy.

	Mr. Poletti is half-led, half-pushed through the doorway.  mrs. 
	Poletti pulls the slider closed behind them.

	INT. CABANA - NIGHT

	A roomy dressing area with an open shower stall at the back.  
	There's a wide, wooden bench along one wall, covered with clothing 
	and towels.

	JESSE stands in the center of the room, putting his pants on.  He 
	is shirtless and shoeless.

	SOUND OVER:  A KNOCK ON THE DOOR

						LISA (O.S.)
			Jesse?

	Jesse hesitates, uncomfortable.

						JESSE
			Be out in a minute.

	EXT. CABANA

	Lisa waits for Jesse.  Finally, he unlatches the door.  his shirt 
	is on, unbuttoned.  Lisa steps into the cabana.

	INT. CABANA

	Lisa shuts the door behind her.  The two look at each other a 
	moment.  Then Jesse looks away and continues buttoning his shirt.

						JESSE
			I think I better go.  I'm just not into
			it tonight.  I'm sorry.

						LISA
			Why won't you talk to me?

						JESSE
			Will you leave me alone?  Please.

	Jesse crosses to the bench and sits to put on his shoes.

						LISA
			You're not being fair to me.  I'm 
			worried about you and I want to 
			help you get through this thing.

						JESSE
			What are you gonna do?  How are you 
			gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.
					(breaking down)
			I don't want to have you watch me fall
			apart.

	Lisa goes to Jesse.  She puts a comforting arm on his shoulder.

						LISA
			It's okay, Jesse.

	Jesse takes her hand and holds it tight.  She sits beside him.

						JESSE
					(choked)
			I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to 
			stay awake - I'm ruining your party. 
			They're gonna put me away for sure.

						LISA
			We'll figure it out together.  We'll 
			stay up all night if we have to.  I
			won't let anything happen to you.

	They look into each others eyes.  Lisa kisses him ever so gently, 
	then again.  he kisses her.  Their kisses grow hungrier.

	Love conquers fear and they embrace fully, kissing passionately.

	POOLSIDE

	THREE BOYS are huddled together, looking up at the Poletti's 
	bedroom window.

						BOY ONE
			Any second, now...

	THE BEDROOM WINDOW, THEIR POV

	The lights FLICK OUT.

						BOY ONE (O.C.)
					(quietly)
			Party time.

	ON THE WET BAR

	Someone reaches over to the stereo, pops out the Benny Goodman 
	cassette and flicks the radio on.  Van Halen BLASTS out of the 
	speakers.

	ON KERRY

	In the pool, up to her neck with a HUNK.  They both look up as the 
	music changes.  The top of her bathing suit floats up to the 
	surface.

						KERRY
			Oh, wow, Van Halen.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - THE POLETTI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	At the sound of the music, Mr. Poletti sits up in bed, angrily.

	Mrs. Poletti puts an arm on his shoulder.

						MRS. POLETTI
					(quietly)
			Let them have their fun, Honey.

	Mrs. poletti pulls out a pair of earplugs and hands them to Mr. 
	Poletti, who grumbles, sticks them in his ear and drops back down 
	into his pillow.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	Somebody switches off the lights to general applause.

	BACK TO KERRY AND THE HUNK

	They are in a steamy embrace when the underwater lights go out.

	The rest of her suit pops up out of the water.

	ON SOME BUSHES

	as a COUPLE pulls out a red wagon, stashed in the shrubbery and 
	loaded with beer.

	INT. CABANA - NIGHT

	JESSE and LISA rolling around on the floor, a lot of heavy 
	petting; not doing it but serious, heated stuff just the same.

	HIS HAND, wrapped around Lisa's wrist, pinning it gently to the 
	floor.

	ON LISA

	Her eyes closed; feeling him - definitely feeling him.

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT, JESSE

	Jesse is about to take down Lisa's swimsuit top when an ungodly 
	long iridescent serpent-like TONGUE flicks a foot out of his 
	mouth, wiggles and flicks back in.

	Jesse moans lasciviously, not his own voice.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jesse pushes himself away from Lisa and scrambles to his feet.  
	Lisa, unaware of what happened, is puzzled and upset.

	ON LISA

	sitting up on the floor.

						LISA
			What's wrong?

	Jesse tucks in his shirt and buttons his pants.  he is visibly 
	shaken.

						JESSE
			I'll see you.

	Lisa just looks at him, helplessly.

	He slips out the cabana door and shuts it.

	ON LISA

	she gets up slowly.  She's profoundly worried.

	INT. GRADY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Grady is sleeping on his back, dead to the world.

	Suddenly, a hand clamps down over his mouth.

	A light flicks on.

	LONGER ANGLE:  GRADY'S BEDROOM

	It's JESSE.  A window is open in the B.G., teh curtains in 
	disarray.

	He lifts his hand from Grady's mouth and Grady scrambles out of 
	bed.

						GRADY
					(hoarsely)
			Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out
			of me!

						JESSE
			I'm sorry...

						GRADY
			What are you doing here?

						JESSE
			You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.

						GRADY
			Are you nuts or something?

						JESSE
			Listen to me, Grady, this is serious.
			Something really weird is happening.  It
			started out like just bad dreams but it's
			getting real bad.

	Grady is tired and cranky and he doesn't want ot hear this.

						GRADY
			Aw, will you get out of here!  Go and
			take a sleeping pill or something...

	He flops back down on his bed and puts his arm over his eyes.

						GRADY
			In fact, take a whole bottle and do the 
			world a favor.

	Jesse sits on the edge of the bed.

						JESSE
			I killed Schneider, Grady...

	Grady lifts his arm from his eyes and stares at Jesse 
	preposterously.

						JESSE
					(nods)
			Only it wasn't me - I was there but
			it was like something inside of me,
			moving me around.  Then last night 
			it made me go into my sister's room 
			and tonight, with Lisa in the cabana. 
			We were...on the floor - I felt it
			happening again.

	He grabs Grady's arm.

						JESSE
			It wanted me to kill them, Grady!

	Grady continues his dumbfounded stare.

						GRADY
					(finally)
			You're fucked in the head.

						JESSE
			I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds
			crazy.  But, there's something trying 
			to get into my body.

						GRADY
					(sneers)
			The only thing trying to get into your
			body is female and waiting for you on
			a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep
			with me.  Go figure.

						JESSE
			Look, I don't care if you believe me
			or not...

						GRADY
			I believe you.  You had some scary
			dreams, okay?

						JESSE
					(frustrated)
			No!
					(shakes his head)
			I don't know - everything's all mixed
			up.
					(suddenly angry)
			What difference does it make?  I'm in
			trouble here.  I need your help.

	Grady lets that sink in.

						GRADY
					(softer)
			Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me 
			to do?

						JESSE
			Just watch me.  If anything weird 
			happens - like if I start dreaming 
			weird or try to walk out of here, 
			you gotta try to bring me out of it. 
			his me over the head if you have to.
			Just don't let me leave.

	Grady looks down at the floor, sighs, and nods his head.

						JESSE
			And Grady...

	Grady looks up.

						JESSE
			Don't fall asleep!

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	The underwater lights are still off, the music has calmed down a 
	bit and most of the KIDS are more into necking than swimming.

	TWO BODIES are rolled up in a blanket together.  From a short 
	SQUEAL, we can deduce that it's KERRY and her HUNK.

	The BAR-B-QUE BOY has remained steadfast at his post although his 
	GIRLFRIEND has joined him and he's paying more attention to her 
	than the hotdogs on the grill.

	ON LISA

	She sitting on one of the lounges, her eyes are red from crying.  
	She's being comforted by a girlfriend, PATTY.

						PATTY
			Why don't you just call him?

						LISA
					(tearfully)
			He won't talk to me.

						PATTY
			Well, you're not doing him or yourself
			any good sitting here and worrying.

	Lisa looks at her friend.

						LISA
			I shoud go see him, but...I don't know,
			the party and all...

						PATTY
					(encouragingly)
			Go ahead.  I'll hold down the fort.

						LISA
					(getting up)
			Thanks, Patty.  You're a pal.

	INT. GRADY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Grady is sitting up in bed, staring at the T.V.  He turns to 
	JESSE, slumped in a nearby chair, asleep.

	Grady switches off the TV with the remote.

						GRADY
			Sweet dreams, buddy.

	Grady turns off the READING LIGHT by the bed.  He gives a final 
	look at Jesse before he pushes the whole thing out of his mind 
	with a disgusted wave of his arm and lays back down.

	ON JESSE

	Suddenly, his eyes open widely.

						JESSE
			Grady?

	Grady MUMBLES an obscenity and turns over on his side to face 
	Jesse.

						GRADY
			What?
	
						JESSE
			It's happening again.

	Grady turns the reading light back on in time to see Jesse DOUBLE 
	OVER and curl up in obviously incredible pain, falling to his 
	knees.  He flails out as if 1000 volts were going through his body 
	and begins to choke on his tongue.

	Grady scrambles out of bed and dances around Jesse, not knowing 
	what to do.

	ON JESSE'S HAND

	as he raises it and his fingers spread widely apart.

	Four steel RAZOR-KNIVES tear out from withing the tips of Jesse's 
	fingers like long, bloody switchblades!

	GRADY stands by helplessly as Jesse WRITHES.

	And then it is like some crazed beast in Jesse's gut, tearing its 
	way out of his skin like someone stepping through a thick, latex 
	film.

	As his skin peels away, thousands of capillaries pull apart, 
	spraying blood everywhere in a fine, almost powdery mist.

	The transformation is almost complete when FRED KRUEGER's body 
	steps out of the red cloud.  All that is left of Jesse is his 
	SCREAMING FACE, plastered like a grisly ruber mask over Freddy's 
	own disfigured features.

	Grady backs away toward the door.

						GRADY
					(screaming)
			No!  No!  No!

	ON FREDDY

	He stands up with an evil smile, all there now, and puts on his 
	battered hat.

	ANGLE: GRADY'S BEDROOM

	Grady tries desperately to get out, but the door won't open.  
	Freddy cackles evilly as he cuts off Grady's screams by grabbing 
	his throat with his unarmed hand.  he pushes Grady up against the 
	door and lifts him off the floor like he was hanging a picture.

	We hear MUFFLED CALLS from outside the door - the off-camera cries 
	of concerned PARENTS.

	THE DOORKNOB RATTLES

	as they try to get in the room to check on their son.

	BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!

	a fist, hammering against the door behind Grady's head - his 
	father trying to get in.

						MR. GRADY (O.C.)
			What's going on?  Open the door, Ronny!

	FREDDY draws back his knife-hand and prepares to plunge it into 
	Grady's stomach like he was spearing a pot roast.

	OUTSIDE THE DOOR

	MR. and MRS. GRADY, in their nightclothes.  Mrs. Grady stands with 
	her hands over her mouth as Mr. Grady grabs the know again and 
	BANGS his fist repeatedly against teh door.

	ON FREDDY

	Throwing force into his cutting arm.  We CUT before impact to:

	OUTSIDE THE DOOR

	We hear Grady SCREAM as the steel blades cut through his body and 
	poke out through the door like it was made of balsa.  They wiggle 
	slightly to pull free and are retracted with an ungodly SQUEAK.

	Mrs. Grady screams.

						MR. GRADY
			My God.

	Mr. Grady throws his shoulder with all his might against the door.  
	A second excruciating SCREAM inside, and the knives cut through 
	the door, inches from Mr. Grady's head.  When they pull out, blood 
	is soaking through the knife holes - it looks as if the door 
	itself is bleeding.

	ON GRADY

	breathing his last few gasps.

	ON GRADY'S PARENTS

	They watch in stunned horror.

	ON GRADY

	He sinks slowly to the floor, dead.

	Freddy watches as his victim slides into a heap on the floor.  
	Only we see now that it isn't Freddy anymore but Jesse again, 
	panting exhaustedly and dripping Grady's blood from just under his 
	elbow to the sharp points of the razor-tipped glove he wears on 
	his hand.

	THE DOOR is budging open against Grady's body - a little more with 
	each crash of Mr. Grady's shoulder against the other side.

	Jesse is coming to - himself again, and he views what he has done 
	to his best friend with terror crazed eyes.

	is eye catches his own reflection in a full length mirror on the 
	wall.  The image reflected is of FREDDY.

						JESSE
			No!
					(backing away from 
					 the body)
			No!  No!  No!
					(screaming toward the
					 mirror)
			You son of a bitch!  You killed him!

	Jesse hurls the glove at the mirror, cracking it.  Freddy's 
	mocking image, however, remains.  The last SOUND we hear is a 
	demonic mix of Jesse's own screams and Freddy's cackling laugh.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

	Lisa has changed into a white shirt and a pair of cut-offs.  She 
	hurries downstairs, buttoning up her shirt and crosses the foyer 
	floor to the door.

	She opens the door and JESSE collapses in her arms.  He is bloody, 
	bruised and his clothes are torn and dirty.

						LISA
					(frenzied)
			Jesse, God - what happened?

						JESSE
					(hyperventilating)
			I killed him!  I killed him!

	She draws him in close, trying to comfort him.  She looks at his 
	bloody arms.

						LISA
			Oh, Christ, you're hurt...

						JESSE
					(weeping now)
			I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa.
			I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's 
			inside me...

	Lisa looks around, frantically as she holds Jesse tightly against 
	her body.

						LISA
			Who, Jesse?

						JESSE
			he's just waiting to take me.  When
			I sleep.

						LISA
			Who?  Who's doing this to you?

	He looks at her as if she should know.

						JESSE
			Fred Krueger.
					(psychotically)
			He's been trying to get hold of me, 
			to use me.  He needs me to get out
			of his world into ours...He's gonna
			take me again.

						LISA
			No, Jesse.  This isn't happening.
			It's gotta be everything you've 
			taken in -- Schneider and the diary
			and the glove -- only it's all 
			mixed up.

	He pushes away from her, frustrated.

						JESSE
			No!  Christ, how can I make you 
			understand?  He tried to make me kill
			Angela last night!  Look at the blood
			on my hands!

	He begins to sob.

						JESSE
			Oh, God.  I did that to Grady...
					(suddenly coherent,
					 realizing)
			He owns me.

	Lisa puts her arms around him.  SHe strokes his head, trying to 
	calm him.
	
						LISA
			I'm not gonna let anyone take you from
			me.  There's got to be a reason.  We'll
			figure it out together.

	Suddenly, something makes Lisa stop.

						LISA
			Wait a minute!

	She leads Jesse toward the study entryway and opens the door.

						LISA
			Wait in here for me.  I'll be right back.

	Jesse goes into the study.  Lisa hurries off.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	THE BAR-B-QUE BOY has left his post entirely.  He is sitting on a 
	nearby bench with his GIRLFRIEND on his lap and his chef's hat 
	askew on the back of his head.

	Suddenly, the girl points toward the grill.

						GIRLFRIEND
			Hey, look!

	The kid looks over.

	HIS POV - THE GRILL

	A platter of hot dogs on an attached cutting board.  The hot dogs 
	are exploding, bursting into flames, one by one until the whole 
	plate is engulfed.

						BAR-B-QUE
			Holy Shit!

	He jumps up, picks up the flaming platter with his hands and 
	tosses it like a hot potato onto the cooking grid, slamming the 
	lid down with a CRASH.

	Some of the WITNESSES hoot and laugh and there's a scattering of 
	applause.

	Before Bar-b-que can take a bow for his bravery, his attention is 
	drawn to the sound of rapid POPPING.

	HIS POV

	The WAGON OF BEER on the ground near some bushes.  The pull tabs 
	are popping off and geisers of brew are shooting up toward the 
	sky.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

	LISA opens up the DIARY.  JESSE looks over her shoulder.

						LISA
			Something Nancy said - her last entry.
					(reading)
			"He is evil itself.  I know now that
			I brought him into my world.  We all
			did, gave him all the energy he needed.
			Our screams were all he needed.  Now
			I will take it back - Deny him."

	She looks up at Jesse.

						LISA
			She wasn't crazy.
					(he holds up the book)
			All this really happened.
					(a beat)
			You can fight him.

	Jesse looks confussed.

						LISA
			Remember what I said?  About good
			energy and bad energy?  He thrives 
			on bad energy.  Hate, anger, fear.
			He is bad energy.
					(a beat)
			You've been afraid of him.

	Jesse suddenly winces in painand puts his hand to his stomach.

						JESSE
					(panicking)
			Oh, God, he's coming back!
					(to Lisa)
			Get out of here, Lisa!

										     CUT TO:

	The window SLAMS shut and LOCKS.

	LISA

	frightened, looks behind her and back to Jesse, frantically.

						LISA
			Fight it, Jesse!

	FRONT DOOR, FOYER

	The deadbolt turns with a loud SNAP.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - THE POLETTI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Their bedroom door LATCHES firmly.

	MR. POLETTI sits up with a start.

						MR. POLETTI
			What was that?

	EXT. GATE - LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	A large padlock swings around and SNAPS shut.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

	JESSE is doubled over in pain.  Lisa has her hands on his 
	shoulders, shaking him, trying to bring him out of it.  The heat 
	has become intense in teh room; they are both sweating profusely 
	and their clothes cling to their wet bodies.

						LISA
			You created him - you can destroy him.
			He lives off your fear.  Fight him, 
			Jesse!

						JESSE
					(painfully)
			I can't!

	Tiny bubbles are rising to the top of the aquarium tank and the 
	angelfish float on the surface of the water, poached.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - THE POLETTI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MR. POLETTI is standing inside the door in an open robe, tugging 
	on the knob as MRS POLETTI joins him at his side.

	He, too is drenched with sweat and the heat has steamed up all the 
	interior windows.

						MRS. POLETTI
			What is it?

						MR. POLETTI
			The lock's jammed!

	Suddenly, there is a BLAST OF MUSIC as a bedside CLOCK RADIO comes 
	to life an immediatly begins melting in the center.  The music 
	GROANS to a stop after less than a bar and the amber dial-lamp 
	dies.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	KERRY and HUNK in the pool again.  Steam is rising off the surface 
	and the water seems a bit rough for a swimming pool.

	Kerry calls out to no one in particular.

						KERRY
			Hey, can somebody turn down the heater?

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

	JESSE is writhing on the floor as LISA jumps around him, 
	helplessly.

						LISA
			You're not afraid of him!  He doesn't
			even exist.

	ON THE T.V.

	as it, too, comes to life with a BLAST OF SOUND, SPARKS violently 
	and dies.

	ON THE AQUARIUM

	as the water comes to a boil, the glass SHATTERS and the carpeting 
	is flooded with a wave of steaming water and dead marine life.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	as the Japanese lanterns begin to brighten considerably - as if 
	there's a power surge in the line.  Each of the bulbs begin to 
	burst, scattering a group of screaming TEENAGERS from beneath 
	them.

	INT. STUDY

	ON LISA, JESSE'S POV

	Horrified.

	ON THE DESK FRONT

	as a hand comes up into frame - FREDDY'S hand.  It scrapes up the 
	wooden panel and grips the desktop, cutting four deep notches into 
	the scrolled edge-molding.

	ON LISA

	She GASPS.

	FREDDY is standing in front of her.

						FREDDY
					(laughting hideously)
			He can't fight me.
					(raising his eyebrows)
			I'm him.

	Freddy approaches, flashing his razor-knives like a set of Tiffany 
	rings.

	Lisa looks about the room for some escape.

	Freddy swings.  Lisa counters by pulling an afghan from the back 
	of one of the chairs and catching it in his blades.

	She reaches behind her for something to hit him with and comes up 
	with a heavy brass lamp from the top of the desk.  She SMASHES him 
	over the head with it.

	The impact throws him back long enough for her to slip by him and 
	run out of the study.  She slams the door behind her.

	Freddy recovers quickly from the blow and, angry now, takes after 
	her.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - THE POLETTI BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Mr. Poletti is banging on the door and wrenching the knob.

						MR. POLETTI
			Lisa!

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

	as LISA runs through the room, rounds the newel post of the 
	stairway and skids across the parquet floor to the front door.

	She grabs the knob and pulls.  Locked.

						LISA
					(screaming for help)
			Jesse!

	Panic-stricken, she turns to run.

	FREDDY LEAPS across the room at LISA.  She tries to run past him 
	but collides with him instead.  They both go down on the waxed 
	floor.

	LISA tries to scramble away.  FREDDY grabs her foot and sinks his 
	teeth into her bare calf.  She SCREAMS in pain.

	LISA kicks him in the head with her other foot.

	FREDDY strikes at her leg with his talons, but she twists away and 
	he wedges the blades deep into the oak floor.

	She squirms free as Freddy pull s and pulls on his weapon to un-
	stick it from the floor.  She runs toward the kitchen.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	KERRY and HUNK in the middle of the pool.  The surface is choked 
	with steam and their bodies are lobster-red.  They are trying to 
	get to the stairway at the low end but the water has become even 
	more turbulant and much hotter and randowm waves keep pushing them 
	back, panting, toward the deep end.

	Kerry goes under and Hunk picks her up to hold her head up above 
	the water.

						HUNK
			Help!

	ON THE PATIO

	several BOYS rush to the fence to pull down a life-hook hanging 
	there on a bracket.

	Other TEENS stand around, wondering what's happening.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	LISA is devastatingly frightened as she crashes through the doors 
	and quickly scans the room.

	She runs to the sliding glass doors leading out to the pool area 
	and hurls aside the draperies.

	ON the other side of the glass, FIVE KIDS tug frantically or the 
	door and bang on the glass, trying to get in.

	BACK TO LISA

	She turns toward the counter and spots

	A WOODEN KNIFE-BLOCK

	a good selection of gourmet cutlery.

	FREDDY

	crashes into the room.

	ON LISA

	jumping toward the knives.

	She grabs for the thickest handle and unsheathes it from the 
	block.  This is one hell of a KNIFE - a fourteen inch long blade 
	of carbon steel - all it needs is a blood-gutter to move it from 
	the kitchen to the battlefield.

	THE SLIDERS

	The FIVE KIDS outside the glass doors stare, aghast.

	KITCHEN

	Freddy stops in the center of the room as she swings around, 
	holding the knife in her fist defensively.

						LISA
			Jesse, help!

						FREDDY
			I'm Jesse now, Lisa.

	He chuckles as he raises his own weapon and rhythmically clicks 
	the blades together.  he's up for a feisty victim.

	Lisa tries to get up the courage to send the knife home.

	ON FREDDY

	His expression changes suddenly.

						FREDDY
					(Jesse's voice,
					 pleading)
			Kill me!  Please kill me!

	ON LISA

	She is devastated by teh sound of Jesse's voice coming from within 
	this monster.

	ON FREDDY

	himself again.

						FREDDY
					(mockingly)
			Go agead, Lisa.  Kill him!  Kill him!

	He steps toward her and she swings with the knife.  He jumps back, 
	inches from the blade.

	He laughs and moves for her again.

	This time she swings and hits her mark, driving the knife deep 
	into Freddy's shoulder.

	She PLUNGES the blade in, again and again, pushing him back across 
	the room.  The knife cuts long gashes but they do not bleed and 
	with each puncture of the blade, Freddy lets out a horrible laugh:

						FREDDY
					(Jesse's voice)
			Lisa...Lisa...I love you...I love you!

	Stunned, she steps back into the center of the room.

	She raises the knife again but she is crying hysterically and just 
	doesn't have it in her.

	Freddy catches her wrist with his bare hand and squeezes it with 
	all his strength.

	Lisa begins quaking and her knees weaken.  She closes her eyes.

						LISA
					(tearfully)
			Please, God...

	She drops the knife:  it sticks into the linoleum.

	ON FREDDY

	He starts to mouth a parting death-word but suddenly stops.

	TWO SHOT - LISA AND FREDDY

	Lisa opens her eyes.  He is stell standing there, poised for the 
	kill but he is staring at her with an odd expression - perhaps a 
	glint of recognition.

	Lisa stares back, wondering why she isn't dead yet.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY

	A frown of confusion distorts his ugly face and his lower lip 
	quivers slightly.

	Suddenly, he throws her aside like a fisherman tossing acks an 
	undersized flounder.

						FREDDY
					(as Jesse)
			Nooo...

	ON LISA

	SMASHING into the wall with force.  She slides down to the floor, 
	semi-conscious.

	BACK TO FREDDY

	he emits an agonized SCREAM and LUNGES, not at her but 

	DIVING

	through the glass doors to the pool area.

								     	     SMASH CUT TO:

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as the glass shatters into a million shimmering pieces and Freddy 
	is gone - vanishing before our eyes.

	The pool has stopped swirling although it continues to simmer.  
	KERRY, HUNK and LIFEHOOK BOY cough and shake as they are helped 
	out of the water and wrapped in towels by some FRIENDS.

	Many of the TEENS are huddled in little groups.  Some are crying, 
	others just look at the remnants of the party in disbelief.

						TEENS
			What happened?  Where'd he go.  Etc.

	Several BRAVE BOYS approach the shattered sliders with cautious 
	curiosity.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

	One BRAVE BOY in the group kneels down and touches his hand on the

	ON THE TAPE DECK

	as the cassette pops itself in and switches on GLENN MILLER.  

	BACK 	TO PATIO

	Everyone looks around, spooked.

	Suddenly, there is a huge RIPPING sound and FREDDY violently 
	CRASHES up through the concrete!

	ON THE KIDS

	Screaming at the sight of the monster.

	ON THE POOL

	ON THE DOOR

	as MR. POLETTI bursts through, followed by his wife.

	She screams when she sees

			He couldn't do it, Momma.

	MR. POLETTI looks up at the sound of the OFF-SCREEN SCREAMING.  He 
	rushes across the room to the sliders.

	EXT. POOLSIDE

	Total CHAOS has taken over.  KIDS are running in every direction, 
	screaming as FREDDY lashes out indiscriminately.

	A SCREAMING GIRL is PUSHED INTO THE POOL by the stampeding kids 
	and is SUCKED UNDER.

	TWO BOYS vault the WALL.  One perches on top, holding a hand out 
	to help HIS GIRL over.

						BOY
			Come on!

	FREDDY races at them and SLASHES THE GIRL.  She drops.  The BOY 
	clambers over the wall.

	ON A FLEEING KID

	THE FLEEING KID runs toward camera (no othe rkids in shot).  As he 
	runs, he BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN, as if being held back by an 
	invisible force.  Suddenly, FREDDY APPEARS AND, AT NORMAL SPEED, 
	SLASHES THE KID.

	EXT. CHAIN LINK FENCE - POOLSIDE

	SEVERAL KIDS breaks for the gate.  The PADLOCK is secure.

	ONE KID grabs onto the chain-link fence to climb it.  The links 
	SMOKE AND SIZZLE, and the kid lets go with a scream.

	His HANDS are branded with the pattern of the steel links.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Mr. Poletti turns whit, not believing his eyes.  He backs away 
	from the sliders.

						MR. POLETTI
			My God!

	He backs off some more only taking his eyes off the scene to 
	glance at his wife and daughter.

						MR. POLETTI
			Get her out of here!

	MRS. POLETTI looks back at her husband, questioningly.

						MR. POLETTI
					(urgently)
			Get her out of here!

	She starts to help Lisa to her feet.

	MR. POLETTI turns on his heels and runs through the kitchen doors.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	Freddy stands in the center of the patio, swinging with his claw 
	as a few DO-GOODERS circle him and try to calm him down like he 
	was just some ordinary homicidal maniac.  At Freddy's feet, 
	another hapless VICTIM.

	ONE DO-GOODER who's watched too many police dramas on T.V. jockeys 
	around Freddy and throws out some hostage control lines.

						DO-GOODER
			Now calm down - we want to help you.

	Freddy displays his blades like a rabid cat, ready to strike.

						FREDDY
			Help yourself, fucker.

	Behind them, a row of shrubs suddenly combusts.

	Freddy grabs him by the wrist, laughs and, swinging him around 
	like he were throwing the Hammer, sends him with a bone-splitting 
	CRASH into 

	THE GAS GRILL

	The force of the impact shears the grill from its pedestal and 
	causes a huge column of FIRE to shoot up into the heavens.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

	MR. POLETTI swings one of the chairs into the gun case SHATTERING 
	the glass door.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	The KIDS are trapped inside the pool area, frozen with fear, 
	hysterical.

	With the gas-fire raging to one side, he screams out like an 
	evangelist on angel dust.

						FREDDY
			You are all my children!

	SOUND OVER: A SHOT RINGS OUT

	BLOWING AWAY a dish of potato salad on a table at Freddy's side.

	Several teens dive for cover.

	ON MR. POLETTI

	standing in the frame of the shattered sliders.  he is holding a 
	pump-action shotgun.

	as he brings the gun down to give it a second pump.

						MR. POLETTI
			Shit!

	He raises the weapon again, but LISA rushes out and pushes the 
	barrel of the gun down.  MR. POLETTI FIRES into the patio.

						MR. POLETTI
					(furious)
			What are you doing?

	ON FREDDY

	he looks toward the doors and makes eye contact with Lisa.  
	Suddenly, he turns on his hells and walks

	THROUGH THE BRICK WALL as if it weren't there.  The very top of 
	his head and his hat are higher than the top of the wall and 
	remain solid as he moves through and out the other side.  There is 
	SMOKE AND SCORCH on the bricks where he passed.

	SILENCE and stunned faces.  Frightened whimpers here and there.

						MR. POLETTI
			Where did he go?

	ON LISA

	She puts her hand to her mouth - she knows.  MRS. POLETTI has come 
	onto the patio now and joins her daughter and husband.

	Lisa turns and runs into the house.

						MRS. POLETTI
			Where are you going?

	Lisa is already gone.

	LISA opens the door and gets into the driver's seat.

	SOUND OVER: POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING

	INT. JESSE'S CAR

	She looks at the make-shift switches and tries to remember how 
	Jesse.

	She flicks the toggle and pushes the starter button.  Nothing.

	She remembers the two wires under the dash and twists them 
	together.  She pushes the starter button.

	The starter GROANS.  It doesn't seem like it's going to start.

	ON LISA

						LISA
					(frantically)
			Please work, please.

	The car back-fires and starts.  She puts it into gear and pulls 
	out.

	EXT. DARK HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	as the old FALCON tears down the highway.

	INT. JESSE'S CAR

	LISA is at the wheel, squinting through the darkness, trying to 
	hold the road.

	EXT. ABANDONED POWERHOUSE - NIGHT

	Lisa pulls up to the building and shuts the engine off.

	INSIDE

	She hastily tears a strip of cloth from her shirt and ties it 
	around the wound on her leg.  She gets out of the car.

	She steps up to the front of the building.

	HER POV

	The entrance is ringed by A PAIR OF MANGY WILD DOGS WITH EERIE, 
	UNNATURAL FACES who growl threateningly as she approaches.

	She shows no fear as she steps right up to the enterance.  THey 
	snap at her hands but she doesn't pull them out of the way.  They 
	part, allowing her to pass through.

	INT. POWERHOUSE - NIGHT

	LISA walks in cautiously.  The powerhouse looks fare different 
	than it did in daylight -- mysterious, dangerous, brewing, almost 
	alive.  Steam is leaking from between rusty rivets and torn 
	gaskets and we hear the POUNDING of ancient expansion tanks 
	belching out rancid air.

	The interior is bathed in an electric blue light that 
	intermittently washes pale as hot white arcs flash in distant 
	corners of the building.

	She walks in deeper, carelessly touching her fingers to a large 
	steam pipe and retracting her hand quickly from its blistering 
	sting.

	She stops at the center of the room.  Suddenly, a twinge of pain 
	on her face and she looks down at ehr leg.

	now, serious pain as she bends over and frenziedly pulls up on the 
	make-shift bandage.

	ON HER WOUND

	It is SWARMING with big, black, carpenter ants.

	She screams and brushes them away with her hands, quaking with 
	disgust.

	As abruptly as they appeared, they are gone; the blood-soaked 
	bandage is intact, covering the wound.

	She bhacks away from teh sump and begins climbing the rusted metal 
	stairway up to the catwalk.

	SOUND OVER:  SCRAPING METAL

	She stops midway and looks around, frightened.

	A few seconds to regain her courage and she steps onto the 
	walkway.

	A RAT

	-- the one she met before -- scurries at her.  It stops, stares at 
	her evilly, hisses unnaturally.

	Lisa screams.

	Suddenly, a CAT pounces on the rat.

	The cat looks up at Lisa with ONLY THE TAIL OF THE RAT STICKING 
	OUT OF ITS MOUTH.  Its eyes are demonic, its teeth crooked yellow 
	fangs.  It growls like a beast five times its size.  The cat takes 
	another chomp on the rat, and the rat's tail disappears down its 
	gullet.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	LISA jumps down off the sairway onto the catwalk and starts to 
	run.  She CLANGS over the steel-mesh flooring.

	A section of the catwalk gives way beneath her feet and 

	LISA plummets as if she were dropped through a trap door.  Her 
	arms flail over her head, but her hand manages to grab around a 
	section of handrail that's still solid.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	we see the catwalk is intact - it looks as if her knees just gave 
	out but she continues to hold on to the railing for dear life.

	She tests the flooring by feeling it before attempting to rise ore 
	release her grip.

	She rises and turns around.

	FREDDY is there.

	Lisa SCREAMS.

						FREDDY
			Had your chance.
					(raising his talons)
			Die now!

	He slashes at her.  She ducks and runs back toward the stairway.

	The STAIRWAY IS RED HOT, SMOKING.

	FREDDY closes in.

						FREDDY
			Come to me, Lisa - I'm waiting for you.

	Lisa stops short, looks around desperately.  There is nowhere to 
	go.

						LISA
			Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there!
			Stop him!

						FREDDY
			Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.

	Freddy strikes, cutting Lisa's shoulder.

						LISA
					(screams)
			Jesse!

	Freddy closes in on her.  She is trapped, finished.

						FREDDY
					(smiles perversely)
			Wanna join your little friend?

						LISA
			Where's Jesse?

						FREDDY
			There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.

						LISA
			I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me.
			Jesse!

	Freddy raises his talons for the kill.  The sharp oints are within 
	an inch of her eyes.  Lisa, terrified, summons up all her energy, 
	all her might, and looks Freddy in the eye.

						LISA
			I love you, Jesse!

	Freddy stares at ehr, talons frozen in mid-air.  The horrible hand 
	quivers, as if against an unseen force.  And then --

	The wounds on Freddy's shoulder and chest rip open.

	He looks down at them, surprised.  They bleed real, human blood.

	LONGER ANGLE

	Lisa breaks past him and starts to run but stops suddenly, a few 
	paces from Freddy.  She turns to look at him leaning weakly 
	against the railing, with an expression of confusion on his face 
	that is almost pathetic.  he touches his wounds, surprised.

	Lisa is no longer afraid - she's angry now.  She looks him 
	straight in the eye.

	His razor-knives click together like they're running low on 
	batteries.

	Freddy beckons her over with the knife on his index finger.

						FREDDY
					(Jesse's voice)	
			Come and get me, Lisa.

	Freddy laughs wickedly.

	LISA moves a step toward Freddy.

						LISA
			I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't
			kill me...He's in there and I want
			him back.  I'm gonna take him away
			from you and you're going straight 
			back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!

						FREDDY
					(getting angry)
			Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!

	Lisa moves closer to Freddy.

						LISA
			Come back to me, Jesse.

	She locks her gaze on Freddy's eyes and looks right through him.

						LISA
			I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.

						FREDDY
			He's dead, you bitch.

	Freddy seems to be in a good deal of pain.  He drops to one knee.  
	Lisa moves closer.  He tries to move away from her.

						FREDDY
					(threateningly)
			I'll kill you now.

						LISA
					(ignoring him)
			He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing
			his grip - you can get out.

						FREDDY
			He'll die with me!

	She kneels beside Freddy, takes off his hat and begins to lovingly 
	stroke his head.  he seems to be writhing a bit and emits several 
	frightened moans.

						FREDDY
			He'll die with both of us!

	She gathers all her nerve and moves in closer.

	He lifts his deadly hand and presses it into her chest.  She 
	flinches in pain but continues to come in close until her mouth is 
	almost touching his.

	he moves his blades onto her back, trying to push them into her 
	flesh, but he is too weak to do much damage.

	TIGHTER ANGLE

	Locked in this strange embrace, she presses her lips against his 
	with as much passion as she can muster and KISSES HIM.

	LONGER ANGLE:  FREDDY & LISA

	There is a moment of quiet.  Then smoke starts to rise off of 
	Freddy.  He pushes her away with an excruciating SCREAM.

	The sound of the POUNDING machinery is becoming deafening.  The 
	electric FLASHES are firing more rapidly and arcing across the 
	Power Plant.  The room is RAPIDLY HEATING UP.

	A SMALL FLAME shoots along the railing.

	SMALL FIRES begin to break out on the catwalk around Freddy.

	ANGLE: PAINTED SURFACE

	The PAINT BEGINS TO SMOKE AND BUBBLE with the heat.  As the heat 
	increases it INTO FLAME.

	ON PIPES 

	STEAM begins shooting up from every pipe joint.

	ANOTHER ANGLE:  PIPES

	STEAM shoots out of the valves.  heavy iron VALVE WHEELS SPIN OFF 
	THEIR STEMS and roll down the FLAMING CATWALKS.

	ON LISA

	Surrounded by flames and smoke, she watches it all with fear and 
	amazement.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY

	His flesh is starting to melt.

	LONGER ANGLE:  FREDDY

	He bursts into DENSE, ALL-ENGULFING FLAME.

	The power plant is going crazy:  the steaming, smoking, and 
	flaming all reach their high peak.  Pipes are bursting with steam:  
	valve wheels flying off.

	Andthen everything begins to slow down, ease off.

	The flames are dying down around the charred corpse, and we can 
	see it is no longer moving.

	The little fires around him are also dying down.

	And the smoke, the steam, and the deafening noise abate.

	ON FREDDY'S CORPSE

	The fires are out now.  there is only some smoke.  And the 
	terrible heat has turned to COOL BLUE LIGHT.

	The still smoldering corpse, with its back to us, begins to stir.

	LONGER ANGLE: CATWALK

	Lisa backs away, terrified.  The corpse turns to her -- it is 
	Jesse, his clothes smoldering, his body singed and blackened with 
	soot.  But alive, coming around as if it were all just a bad 
	dream.

	LISA moves to him and cradles him in her arms.

										    FADE OUT

	FADE IN:

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - DAY

	A SHINY NEW SCHOOL BUS rolls down the street.  It pulls up by the 
	curb near the Walsh House.

	JESSE, his RIGHT ARM IN A SLING but otherwise fresh and happy, 
	kisses MOM goodbye at the FRONT DOOR.  He hurries down to the bus, 
	gets in.  The DOORS fold shut, the GEARS GRIND and the bus 
	continues along its route.

	INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

	There are about a DOZEN KIDS in the bus, playing radios, having a 
	good time, etc.

	LISA, in the back, waves to Jesse and smiles.  She wears a BANDAGE 
	on her shoulder where Freddy slashed her.  Jesse, in the front 
	smiles and waves back.

	Jesse makes his way down the aisle to Lisa, greeting a few kids, 
	slapping a hand or two.

	ON JESSE & LISA

	Jesse plops down next to her, gives her a quick kiss, puts his 
	good arm around her.

						JESSE
			Hi.

						LISA
			Hi.

	Lisa chuckles.

						JESSE
			What's so funny?

						LISA
			We must look like a couple of escapees
			from a veterans' hospital.

	Jesse smiles and shakes his head.

						JESSE
			I can't believe we actually --

	Lisa puts a finger to her mouth to cut him off -- no need to tell 
	about unpleasant things.  Jesse smiles again -- she's right.  he 
	kisses her.

	Jesse moves his head away from hers for the big kiss.  Lisa's eyes 
	are closed, ready to receive it.

	She opens her eyes.  They are pupil-less, blood-streaked, demonic.  
	With an EVIL ROAR, a huge SERPENT TONGUE FLICKS OUT of her mouth 
	and attacks Jesse who screams.

	EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAY

	The bus WHINES near the top end of third, all of its FLASHERS 
	firing wildly.  It races away through the desert in a cloud of 
	dust.
