              FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3: 3D


              FADE IN:
 
              TITLE AND CREDITS
 
              A piercing high note is sustained on the soundtrack as the
              main title, "CRYSTAL JAPAN" speeds straight at the audience
              in 3-D and seems to jump right out at them.
 
              The opening credits follow.  Ominous theme music fills the
              soundtrack, growing darker and more dissonant.
 
              The theme music slowly dissolves into the sound of a radio
              news broadcast, as the credits continue to unfold.

                               (continuing)
                        Crystal Lake in Pinehurst County,
                        the scene of several unsolved
                        deaths years ago, is tragically
                        back in the top of the news this
                        morning.  Police have uncovered
                        the remains of eight, as yet,
                        unidentified persons in a gruesome
                        and baffling story of mass
                        murder...
 
              End credits.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. ROADSIDE MARKET - EVENING
 
              Shooting over a line of ruffled bushes with leaves just
              turning towards a rural, time-worn country market.  A wide
              gravel parking area makes it accessible to the highway
              running past it, otherwise, this Mom & Pop store seems almost
              like a vision of times gone by.
 
              The bushes and overgrown grass, unrestrained by any human
              care, strengthen the sense of isolation.  The dying sun
              shoots its last rays through the trees behind the market.
 
              The market has a battered second-story: the living quarters
              of the people running it.  A truck roars by.  Then silence,
              and then again the sound of the radio news report:

                                  RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        ...Judging from the sheer
                        brutality of the murders, police
                        theorize that they must have been
                        committed by at least four
                        persons...
 
              EXT. THE HOUSE / STORE - ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Sagging clotheslines cluttered with drying laundry run across
              a narrow backyard, all the way to a rickety old shed.  The
              clotheslines are supported by one solitary pole.  Linen and
              garments billow in the rising evening breeze.
 
              Cold, foreboding music accompanies the camera as it moves
              toward a pair of flapping khaki pants and an olive green
              workshirt hanging side by side on the line.
 
              The radio news report grows louder as the clothing snaps
              directly into the lens.
 
                                  RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        ...The sole survivor of the
                        massacre has been taken under
                        heavy sedation to County Hospital
                        in Linfield for observation.
                        She's been unable to provide
                        police with any clues and is being
                        kept under round the clock guard...
 
              HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
 
              And then a man parts two shrouds of wet laundry, making his
              way back towards the house.  This is HAROLD: 40ish, paunchy,
              unshaven and so clumsy that he hits the clothesline pole and
              knocks it down, burying himself under a heap of linen.  A
              transistor radio pops out of the pocket of his threadbare
              shirt, still broadcasting the news.  One of the upstairs
              windows opens with a creak, and
 
              EDNA
 
              Harold's wife, sticks her head out and looks into the
              backyard:
 
                                  EDNA
                               (loud, harsh)
                        Goddamnit Harold!  I spent all day
                        yesterday washing your clothes and
                        look what you're doing to 'em.
                        Shows how much you care about me.

              Harold watches her from under the pile of laundry.  Then he
              grabs the radio, staggers up, increasing the radio's volume
              as he does so, to drown out the voice of his wife.
 
              Above him, Edna raves on for a moment (we can't make out what
              she is saying), then furiously slams the window shut.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. UPSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - EVENING
 
              The room is musty and cluttered like an old attic.  Edna
              stomps away from the window and turns her attention to the
              partially functional, old clunker of a black and white TV.
              She plops herself down onto the lumpy couch and picks up two
              knitting needles and returns to work on a sweater.  A news
              report about the mass murders is being broadcast.
 
              INSERT - TV
 
                                  TELEVISION REPORTER
                        ...A police spokesman tells
                        Eyewitness News that authorities
                        have been combing the area since
                        just before dawn.  Reports of
                        cannibalism and sexual mutilation
                        are still unconfirmed...
                        Nevertheless, these murders are
                        already being called the most
                        brutal in local history.
 
              EDNA
 
              Leans in to adjust the long rabbit-ear antenna, spreading the
              ears apart for a better picture.  She listens intently.
 
                                  TELEVISION REPORTER
                        The motive behind the grisly
                        murders remains a mystery at this
                        hour as does the identity of the
                        killer or killers.  The search
                        continues for more bodies.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (to herself)
                        My God, My God, My God.
 
                                  TELEVISION REPORTER
                        ...Residents of the Lake region
                        are being urged to take extra
                        precaution when approaching
                        strangers and to report anything
                        unusual to police, immediately.
                        We'll be back with the weather
                        forecast after this important
                        message.
 
              Visibly upset, Edna rises to her feet.  She goes over to the
              door leading downstairs to the market, opens it and call out.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Harold, what're you doing down
                        there?
 
              No response.  She rushes to the window, jerks it open and
              sticks her head out.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        Harold... I want to talk to you.
 
              No answer.
 
              EXT. BACKYARD - EDNA'S POV
 
              of the backyard.  The laundry quietly swells in the wind.
              For an instant, a human form is visible between layers of
              drying clothes.  From this distance, Edna can't make out who
              it is.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Harold?
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Unnerved by the continuing noise of the TV, Edna goes back to
              shut it off.  She quickly returns to the window and looks out
              again.
 
              EDNA'S POV
 
              No sign of anyone, but there is an empty span of clothesline
              where several articles of clothes were hung, only a second
              before.
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Edna runs for the apartment door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. MARKET - EVENING
 
              Edna flies down the stairs and enters the store from the
              back.  The market is dark, save does shafts of dying sunlight
              through the grimy front windows.

              She scans the few aisles back and forth.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Harold?
 
              A big rabbit appears from behind an arrangement of Campbell's
              soup cans, and stands on its hind legs on the aisle, trying
              to guess Edna's next move.  Still calling Harold, she turns;
              starts at the sight of the rabbit; she grabs a tomato from
              the produce display, throw it at the animal.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        God Damn pest, what are you
                        staring at?
 
              She misses, grabs more vegetables and hurls them at the
              rabbit.  The rabbit dodges them, and scurries away.
 
              EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING
 
              The sunlight is almost gone, stretching the shadows even
              more.  In her nightgown, Edna pushed open the creaky screen
              door and steps out into the backyard.
 
              Shooting towards her through the laundry flapping on the
              clothesline.  As she touches a set of pajamas and finds out
              that they are still wet.
 
              A shoulder suddenly enters the flame, and someone's
              silhouette blocks the screen just for a couple of seconds,
              before the intruder slips behind another curtain of drying
              clothes, revealing Edna again:  she's still checking the
              clothes and hasn't noticed anything.
 
              She comes to where the trousers and workshirt were, and no
              longer.  That's a shock, but she's not quite sure that they
              were here in the first place, so she goes on, and starts
              talking to herself to fortify her ailing courage.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Christ All Mighty, Harold, you
                        just take what's yours and leave
                        the rest for me to do.  Very
                        considerate!
                               (collecting the dry
                                laundry and putting
                                it in a basket)
                        You could at least finished the
                        job.  Do I have to do everything
                        around here?
 
              Edna hears a noise and whips around.  Her imagination is
              working overtime.

              A bedsheet is swelling slowly in the breeze, taking the shape
              of a human body.  Is anyone behind it?  Ominous music...
 
                                  EDNA
                               (swallowing hard)
                        Harold... I swear, sometimes
                        you're such a child...
 
              She charges forward.  She rips the sheet off the line and
              falls in a heap with it.  There is no one behind it.
 
              She turns over and lays on her back.  Above her, there's only
              the dark evening sky and the branches of a tree, rustling
              back and forth.
 
              Edna gets up and quickly pulls the remaining laundry off the
              lines, tossing it into the basket.  As she does, she passes
              near the wooden shed at the back of the store.
 
              EXT. YARD
 
              The shed door creak open.  Edna turns around.  Suddenly,
              there's a crashing noise from inside.  That's enough for
              Edna... she hauls up the basket and rushes back inside the
              store.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. MARKET - NIGHT
 
              The white rabbit that gave Edna such a scare is now hopping
              across a row of canned goods.  A man's hand enters frame and
              grabs the rabbit by the nape of its neck and lifts it off the
              shelf, into his arms.
 
              It's Harold.  He places the rabbit on his shoulder and grabs
              a jar of peanuts from the shelf.  He twists open the vacuum-
              sealed jar and wolfs down a handful of its contents.  With
              another handful, he feeds the rabbit, who sniffs and partakes.
 
              Harold rescrews the lid and places it back on the shelf.  He
              turns on the radio in his breast pocket.  Music blares.
 
              He grabs his broom and starts sweeping down the aisle, the
              rabbit remaining contentedly on his shoulder.
 
              Harold stops at the dairy case and grabs a half-gallon jug of
              milk.  He breaks the seal and pulls off the cap.  He first
              offers the rabbit a taste, then gulps down a swig himself.

              IN THE BACKGROUND
 
              An unidentified face, in soft focus, peers in through the
              storefront window then disappears almost as quickly.  Harold
              is unaware.
 
              HAROLD
 
              screws the cap back on and replaces the jug in the case.
 
              The sound of crunching and munching.
 
              Harold turns around.  The the produce section, the cellophane
              packages of carrots on display are moving slightly.
 
              He reaches in and pushes off the top few packages to reveal,
              underneath, another rabbit, a grey one this time, nibbling on
              a carrot.
 
              He lifts the rabbit out of the case and places it on his
              opposite shoulder.
 
                                  HAROLD
                               (looking from one
                                rabbit to the other)
                        Sorry guys, it's back to the
                        slammer before Edna make a fur
                        coat out of ya.
 
              On his way to the back door, Harold passes a rack of cakes
              and pies.  He stops long enough to open a box of six
              chocolate-covered donuts.  He takes one out and shoves it
              into his mouth.
 
              Unbeknownst to Harold, a human form in shadow appears at the
              back door.  The door is quietly pushed open.  Someone is
              watching him.
 
              The camera as stalker enters the store and moves slowly
              towards Harold, his back to us.  Ominous music accompanies
              the approach.
 
              Checks filled to capacity.  Harold closes the package and
              puts it back in place on the rack, hiding it under several
              unopened packages.
 
              Harold turns.  The stalker is right behind him, completely
              startled, he jumps back and chokes on the doughnuts.  The
              rabbits hop off his shoulders.
 
              Unexpectedly, Harold find himself face to face... with his
              wife, Edna.

                                  EDNA
                        Didn't I feed you enough for
                        breakfast?
 
              Harold doesn't answer.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        The doctor said you had to lose
                        weight, didn't he?  I try to help
                        you but you sneak food behind my
                        back.  What am I gonna do with you?
 
              Without a word, Harold bends down to retrieve the rabbits.
              He scoops them up in his arms.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        And put those filthy animals back
                        where they belong, please!
 
              Harold exits by way of the back door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
 
              Harold puts the grey rabbit on his shoulder, the white rabbit
              remains wrapped in his arms.  He swallows the rest of the
              doughnut in his mouth as he flips a flashlight out of his
              back pocket and ambles across the yard.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. SHED - NIGHT
 
              Light filters through the cracked walls partially
              illuminating a variety of tools, old barrels, various odds &
              ends - and a rabbit hutch.
 
              Harold flicks on the flashlight as he enters.  The rabbit
              atop his shoulder jumps off and scurries away.  The rabbit in
              his arms squirms and squeals.  The animals sense that
              something is wrong.
 
                                  HAROLD
                               (stroking the white
                                rabbit)
                        What're you little guys so nervous
                        about?
 
              He scans the shed with the flashlight to locate the runaway
              as he tries to contain the jittery ball of fur in his arms.

              The flashlight searches each corner, until the beam finally
              stops on:
 
              THE RABBIT HUTCH
 
              Music pounds hard on the soundtrack, as through the hutch
              grillwork we can see a mass of dead rabbits, lying one next
              to the other, staring up with glinting, glass eyes.
 
              Harold stands immobilized, in a state of shock.  He looks
              down upon the limp bodies of his beloved pets, his face
              turned into a sad mask of outrage.  He holds onto the white
              rabbit even tighter.
 
                                  HAROLD
                        Who would do this...?
 
              Trembling, Harold reaches to lift the lid of the hutch.  The
              music throbs...
 
              A big timber rattlesnake springs out of the hutch, mouth wide
              and open, twin poisonous fangs shining in the beam of the
              flashlight.
 
              The music drops out as the snake's loud kiss dominates.  The
              muscles of its dark, lean body push the deadly mouth ahead,
              into the lens of the camera.
 
              Instinctively, Harold slams the hutch down, dropping his
              flashlight and the white rabbit.  The snake hisses and spits
              at the camera through the wife mesh.
 
              Literally scared shitless, Harold races out of the shed,
              holding his stomach with both hands.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
 
              Harold dashes through the back door, and up the stairs like
              a charging bull.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. UPSTAIRS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
 
              Harold bursts through the door, crashing into his
              unsuspecting wife.  Edna is knocked off balance and tries to
              hold onto him.
 
                                  EDNA
                        What happened?  What's the matter?

              Harold can't talk.  He rubs his stomach and heads straight
              for the bathroom, vanishing inside.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        It's all the crap you've been
                        stuffing yourself with.
 
              Edna turns up the volume on the TV and plunks herself down on
              the couch.
 
              She reaches for her knitting bag and empties its contents.
              One of her two, long, thin knitting needles is missing.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (rummaging all around
                                her)
                        Now where could that other needle
                        have gone?
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. STOREROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              The room is a combination:  storing place mostly, there are
              two ample cupboards facing each other, each leaning against
              a wall, a mess of crates and boxes lying on top of each other
              behind a dusty curtain... and a toilet bowl, left from the
              days when this was just an oversized bathroom.  The toilet
              bowl is against the fourth wall, at an angle behind the door.
 
              The sound of the TV filters through the door as Harold,
              trousers down to his knees, sits on the toilet, sighing with
              relief as the first bout of diarrhea is over.
 
              He loosens his collar, wipes some sweat from his brow,
              reaches behind the toilet tank, and produces a hidden bottle
              of Whiskey.
 
              He unscrews the cap and takes a hardy swig.  He leans back
              and shut his eyes.
 
                                  HAROLD
                               (to himself)
                        Those poor little creatures...
 
              Another swig.  Some of the liquor spills over his chin and he
              wipes it with his sleeve.  His eyes wander around aimlessly,
              then focus on...

              THE DUSTY CURTAIN
 
              partially masking the mess of boxes and crates.  It seems to
              ripple subtly, moved by an ever so slight movement of air,
              perhaps someone's breath?
 
              Harold waits.  The curtains seem still.  Harold is about to
              relax when a brief, hollow noise is heard.
 
              Harold tries to locate the noise, but it's over before he can
              tell its source.  Pants around his ankles, he rises, shuffles
              to one of the closets.  It takes some courage to yank the
              door open, and the camera moves fast into a...
 
              FLAT CLOSEUP of empty shelves - nothing has touched them in
              a long time, except dust.
 
              Breathing relief, Harold pulls up his pants again, just
              enough to be able to hobble grotesquely to the dusty curtain.
              He rips it apart, stares at the odd assortment of boxes and
              crates - empty, lifeless, and uncannily menacing because of
              their lifelessness.
 
              Reassured, Harold gives the other closet a glance, almost
              decides against checking it - and then changes his mind, and
              stumbles, pants still around his ankles, towards it.
 
              Looks like this one hasn't been opened at all for a long
              time.  Harold tugs at the door - a creak, followed instantly
              by a musical stinger as a huge hand holding a meat cleaver
              rips into the shot, strikes Harold, imbedding the cleaver in
              his chest.
 
              Harold manages a half-scream that mixes incongruously with
              the laughter from the TV in the living room.  As the hand
              twists the cleaver, the scream becomes a raspy cough.
 
              Harold stumbles backwards and crashes to the floor.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              Edna hears the crash.  She turns off the television.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Harold?
 
              No answer.  She gets up from the couch and goes to the
              bathroom door.  She listens and hears the noise of the toilet
              flushing and flushing, as if someone's hand never released
              the lever.

                                  EDNA
                               (rattling the door
                                knob)
                        Harold... what's taking you so
                        long in there?  You all right?
 
              She pushes against the door.  It doesn't budge.  She looks
              down and notices some kind of liquid seeping out from
              underneath the bathroom door.  She dips her fingers in it and
              sniffs.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        Whiskey, I thought so.
 
              She goes over to a desk, opens a small drawer and finds a
              skeleton key.
 
              She hurries back to the bathroom/storeroom door, ready to
              insert the key.  To her shock, the door is now open a crack!
 
              For a moment, Edna is nonplussed.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        Harold!
 
              She pushes the door - it swings open, revealing the open
              closets, the boxes and crates...
 
              INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              Edna steps inside and inadvertently kicks the half-empty
              bottle of Whiskey.  She picks up the bottle while the
              flushing noise persists maddeningly.
 
              She turns toward the toilet, which is behind the door and
              screams at the sight of Harold sitting there.
 
              HAROLD
 
              pants down, like a grotesque dummy, blood drooling out of the
              corners of his mouth, the meat cleaver sticking out of his
              chest and one elbow stuck against the flushing handle.
 
              The Whiskey bottle falls from Edna's hand, hits the floor and
              shatters.
 
              Edna screams uncontrollably.
 
              From behind her a huge hand enters the flame and pierces the
              back of her head with the previously missing knitting needle.
              The needle is pushed out through her mouth, right at the
              camera.

              she gags on her own blood and slums out of frame.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING
 
              A group ethnic children are playing stickball in the street,
              weatherworn two and three-family houses on either side of
              them.
 
              A red passenger van screeches around the corner and heads
              down the block, slowing down as it advances on the oblivious
              children.  The driver sounds the horn, warning of the van's
              approach.  Most of the children scatter, but a few don't,
              yelling and banging on the sides of the van as it passes.
 
              The van continues for a few yards then parallel parks in the
              first available space.
 
              The driver Chris...19, blond, attractive but intense...steps
              down and circles around to the passenger side where two
              others jump out.  They are Debbie...19, brown-haired,
              vivacious and healthy, the all-american cheerleader
              type...and Andy...slims, athletic and ruggedly handsome.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Which one is it?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (pointing)
                        It's the last house on the left.
                        She lives downstairs.
 
              Chris turns back to the van.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (calling through
                                window)
                        Hey Shelly!  Come on out and meet
                        your date.
 
                                  SHELLY'S VOICE
                               (from inside van)
                        Bring her to me!
 
              Chris looks back at Andy and Debbie for advice.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (shrugging his
                                shoulder)
                        What're you gonna do?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

              Chris calls into the van once again.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        How about you two?  You coming?
 
              Two other voices shout back:
 
                                  VOICES
                               (in unison)
                        No!
 
              Chris throws up her hands in frustration, joining Andy and
              Debbie.  They cross the street abreast.
 
              CAMERA TRACKS in front of the three friends.  A rotund,
              ominous-looking figure in a hideous, ghostly white mask
              springs out from around the hidden side of the van.  The
              figure follows a safe distance behind the unsuspecting
              threesome, brandishing a knife.
 
              As they walk, Andy and Debbie are locked in each other's arms
              and they begin to kiss.  Chris looks at them and shakes her
              head.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Sex, sex, sex.  You guys are
                        getting boring, you know that?
 
              Debbie breaks the kiss, feeling a little embarrassed.
 
                                  ANDY
                        So what would a weekend in the
                        country be without sex?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (stern)
                        Cool it, Andy.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (apologetic)
                        I didn't mean it the way it
                        sounded...
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I know you didn't...
 
              Little by little, the masked figure advances from behind.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (to Andy and Debbie)
                        Look guys, I don't want to ruin
                        your weekend.  What happened to me
                        at the cottage happened a long time
                        ago and I think I've worked that out.
                        I'm all right now.
 
              The figure draws even closer raising the knife above his head.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (continuing)
                        I appreciate the fact that you
                        worry about me, but don't.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Okay, we won't.  We'll just have
                        fun, all agreed?
 
              The masked figure rears back and plunges the knife into
              Andy's back.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Aaahhh!
 
              The rubber knife bends in half.  Andy, Debbie and Chris whirl
              around to face the assailant.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (continuing)
                        Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always
                        have to be such an asshole!
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (still wearing the
                                mask)
                        I beg your pardon, I'm not an
                        asshole.  I'm an actor.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Same thing.
 
              Chris and Debbie, in disgust, turn away and walk off.  Andy
              drops back to walk with Shelly.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (paternal)
                        Look Shelly, you're my roommate
                        and I like you... most of the
                        time.  But you gotta stop doing
                        these things.  Now, I set this
                        date up for you, didn't I?  So
                        don't embarrass me.  When you meet
                        this woman, just relax and be
                        yourself.

                                  SHELLY
                        Would you be yourself...
                               (ripping off mask)
                        ...if you looked this this?
 
              Shelly puts on a pair of unflattering prescription glasses.
              Although he has a pleasant face, Shelly is overweight, greasy-
              haired and unkempt.
 
              Chris and Debbie lead the way for Andy and Shelly up the
              porch steps, to the front door of a shabby, two-family house.
 
              Chris rings the bell.  Shelly takes a few steps back.  He
              mats down his unruly hair, tucks in his shirt and takes off
              his glasses.  He's ready.
 
              The door opens and a middle-aged Hispanic woman stands behind
              the outer screen door.
 
                                  MOTHER
                               (Spanish accent)
                        Yes?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (friendly)
                        Hi, Mrs. Sanchez.  I'm Chris.
                        We've come to pick up Vera.
 
                                  MOTHER
                               (bruskly)
                        She's not going.
 
              She shuts the door in Chris' face.  The group stands there
              not knowing what to do next.  V.O.'s from inside the house
              they can hear Vera and her mother arguing in Spanish.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        What are they saying?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
 
              They all turn to leave when suddenly the front door swings
              open.  This time Vera, knapsack over her shoulder, ready to
              go, comes out onto the porch.  She's a knockout...20, exotic,
              raven-haired beauty...in tight jeans.  They turn and stare at
              her.
 
                                  VERA
                               (forcing a smile)
                        Hi everybody, what're you looking
                        at.  Let's go.

              Shelly, intimidated by Vera's sexy good looks, steps behind
              Andy and slips the mask back over his face.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (to Vera)
                        Is everything okay?
 
                                  VERA
                        You know, just your basic old
                        fashioned mother problems.
                               (changing the subject)
                        So, where's my date?
 
              Shelly comes out from behind Andy.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (sheepishly)
                        Hi.
 
                                  VERA
                               (letting her
                                disappointment show)
                        You're Shelly?
 
                                  SHELLY
                        I'm sorry.
 
              Andy angrily rips the mask off Shelly's face.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (looking across the
                                street)
                        Hey!  The van's on fire!
 
              EXT. VAN
 
              White smoke billows out of the van windows, engulfing the
              vehicle and the luggage tied to the top.
 
              The whole group rushes off the porch and races to the van.
              The first one there, Andy, opens the passenger side door and
              jumps in.  Chris runs around to the driver's side and does
              the same.
 
              INT. VAN
 
              Through thick, acrid smoke, Chili and her boyfriend, Chuck...
              Cheech and Chong lookalies...can be seen sitting in the back
              on the floor, each puffing away like crazy on a bong filled
              with Marijuana.  Each wears a stereo headset that is plugged
              into their own Sony Walkman portable cassette players.
 
              Andy and Chris looks at each other as if to say "I should
              have known."

                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING
 
              Chris' red van speeds along the empty rural highway through
              the lush New England countryside.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. VAN - MORNING
 
              Through the driver's side window, the wind blows in on Chris
              and tosses her flaxen hair as she drives.  Debbie sits on
              Andy's lap in the passenger seat - the only other seat in the
              van.
 
                                  ANDY
                        How much farther to the cottage?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        We could've been there already...
                               (looking at Debbie)
                        ...if some people didn't have to
                        go to the bathroom every five
                        minutes.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (defensive)
                        Oh yeah...well just hope that you
                        never get pregnant, 'cause all you
                        do all the time is piss!
 
              REAR OF THE VAN
 
              Chili and Chuck are sprawled out on the floor, taking
              inventory of their numerous joints and bags of Marijuana.
 
              Shelly sits cross-legged near the very back of the van,
              opposite Vera, who sits with her legs open.  Daydreaming, she
              gazes upward at the sky and treetops through the back window.
 
              Shelly can't stop staring at Vera, admiring her sexy body.
              Vera senses that Shelly is undressing her with his eyes and
              quickly turns her head around and catches him looking at her
              breasts.  Shelly averts his eyes in embarrassment and looks
              over at Chuck who lights up a joint, inhales and hands it
              Chili.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Is that all you two are gonna do
                        this weekend...smoke dope?

                                  CHUCK
                        Why not, man?  Is there a law
                        against it?
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (persisting)
                        There's better things to do with
                        your life.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (confused)
                        Like what?
 
                                  CHILI
                               (inhaling)
                        I can't think of anything.
 
              She offers the joint to Shelly.  He declines.  Chili offers
              it to Vera.
 
                                  VERA
                        Sure, why not.
 
              Vera comes forward on her hands and knees, reaching out for
              the joint.  As she does, she inadvertently thrusts her
              shapely rear end almost into Shelly's face.  Shelly makes no
              attempt to retreat from it.  Actually he rather enjoys it.
 
                                  VERA
                               (as she draws on the
                                joint)
                        Is this stuff any good?
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Home grown, man!  Of course it's
                        good!
 
                                  CHILI
                        And it's good for you, too.
                        Strictly organic.  No
                        preservatives, man.
 
              Andy sniffs at the air around him filled with the aroma of
              good grass.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Hey, let's share the wealth with
                        those less fortunate up front here.
 
              Vera passes the joint to him and sits back down across from
              Shelly.
 
              Shelly is rummaging through a small black suitcase. It's
              contents are concealed from Vera's view.

                                  VERA
                               (curious)
                        What d'ya got in there?
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (very secretive)
                        My whole world.
 
                                  VERA
                        In that little thing?
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Stick around and you'll see.
 
              Vera turns away and looks out the back window.
 
              We can hear the faint sounds of sirens.
 
              EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
 
              In the distance, two police cruisers, with lights flashing,
              in hot pursuit.
 
              INT. VAN
 
                                  VERA
                               (to the others)
                        Better hide that grass.  It's the
                        cops.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (looking out her
                                sideview mirror)
                        Oh, no.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (looking out the back
                                window)
                        What are we gonna do?
 
                                  VERA
                        Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
 
                                  CHILI
                               (looking right at
                                Chuck)
                        Yes, man!
 
              They all look at one another, perplexed.  Vera is amused.
              Without a word and simultaneously, Chili and Chuck begin to
              stuff loose grass and joints into their mouths.

                                  CHUCK
                               (mouth full)
                        Come on, dig in!
 
                                  ANDY
                               (grabbing a bag)
                        Aw shit!
 
              He starts to eat.  Vera joins in, too.  The police sirens
              grow louder.
 
              EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
 
              The cruisers advance.
 
              INT. VAN
 
              Andy grabs another bag and hands it to Chris.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Here...eat.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Try me some other time.  I'm
                        driving.
 
              Andy turns to Debbie and offers up the cellophane bag.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Breakfast?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
 
              The sirens seem to be getting closer.  Chili leans in behind
              Chris.

              The van speeds up, but so do the police cruisers, even
              narrowing the gap.

              Chili, Chuck, Andy and Vera's cheeks are filled to capacity
              with dope.  Their faces are turning green.  Still they
              continue to stuff in more at a frantic pace.

              Shelly holds his black suitcase tightly to his chest as he
              watches out the back window with concern.
 
                                  SHELLY

              To appease everybody, Shelly begins to nibble ever so
              slightly on the marijuana out of Vera's hand.

                        the van over.  Hurry up and

              Chris pulls the van to the side of the road.  She sticks her
              head out to watch for the approaching cruisers.  Much to her
              surprise and everyone else's, both police cars zoom by the
              van without stopping.

              Her fingers reach inside her bra -- but instead of freeing
              her breasts, she pulls out a good size plastic bag of
              marijuana.  Chuck's mouth drops open.

              The two police cruisers make a sharp right into the small Mom
              'n Pop store parking lot and SCREECH to a halt.
 
              A small group of curious onlookers congregate at the front
              entrance of the store.
 
              The cruiser lights continue to flash red and blue as the
              Police Officers step out of their vehicles.
 
              The Officers order the onlookers to "go home" then enter the

              Chris' red van approaches down the highway.

              at them:  plaintive, shy, and yet somehow ominous.

              The van screeches to a halt and backs up to Abel.  The side

              Chris adjusts her rearview mirror to include Abel.
 
              Abel nods "hello" to one and all.  They nod back.

                        You are, all of you, very kind and
                        generous young people to lend a
                        helping hand to a tired, old man.
                        Thank you very much.  Perhaps I
                        can repay the kindness.
 
              The civilized speaking-manner of the shabby-looking stranger
              calms the layer of fear that any might have had.

                        I mean, is there any place in
                        particular where we can drop you
                        off?
 
                                  ABEL
                        Drop me off?  How do you mean?
 
              Shelly's suspicions return and he glances from Vera to Debbie
              and Andy.  Andy shrugs his shoulders.
 
              Abel reaches into his dusty dufflebag and pulls out a very
              small bundle wrapped in a scrap of cloth.
 
              Chris watches via the rearview mirror.  Her expression is
              wary.
 
              Abel unwraps the object and places it in front of Shelly's
              face.

                                  ABEL
                        I found this today.  There were
                        other pieces of the body lying
                        there, but I believe "he" wanted
                        me to have this...

                        That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!

                                  ABEL
                        "He" wanted me to warn you.
                               (evangelical)
                        Look at this, all of you!
 
              He holds the eyeball out for each to view.  They shrink back
              away from him, cringing at the sight.
 
              The eyeball is reflected in the rearview mirror.  Chris is
              becoming quite upset.
 
                                  ABEL

              The van comes to an abrupt stop.  The side door opens and the
              old man is practically tossed out.
 
              On the ground, Abel yells after the van as it speeds away.
 
                                  ABEL

              The van is parked on the shoulder of the highway.
 
              Chris leans against a tree, her arms crossed over her chest.
              She looks towards the woods, waiting.
 
              In front of her face, two sneakered feet pass by.  It's Andy,
              walking on his hands.
 
              Vera stretches her arms over her head then drops her torso
              and arms to the ground, bent over.

                        Some their arms....

                        And some nothing at all.

              From out of the woods, Debbie appears.  She zips up the front
              of her jeans and approaches the others.  Chris and Vera
              applaud.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        I can't help it.
 
              Smiling, Chris puts her arms around Debbie's shoulder and the
              two walk toward the van.
 
              From seemingly out of nowhere, the ROAR of MOTORCYCLES is
              suddenly upon them.
 
              The group whisks around to find three souped-up motorcycles
              bearing down on them, navigated by a manacing-looking TRIO.
 
              The motorcycles head straight for them.  In a panic, the
              group scatters.  Dust swirls as the Motorcyclists veer away
              from the group and the van just in time to avert a collision.
 
              As the dust settles, the group picks themselves off the
              ground.

              The others have assumed their respective positions.  However,
              the jovial atmosphere has degenerated due to the unsettling
              series of incidents.
 
              Long faces and silence prevails.
 
              Then, up ahead just off the road, a pleasant surprise, for
              them all.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Wake up, everybody.  Revenge is
                        ours.
                               (pointing out the
                                front window)
                        Look!
 
              Chris slows down the van.  The group quickly moves forward
              and peers out the front windshield.  One by one, a smile
              crosses each dour face.

              THEIR POV - EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
 
              The Three Motorcyclists have been pulled over by a State
              Trooper and are being ticketed.
 
              INT. VAN
 
              The van erupts into laughter and cheers.
 
              EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
 
              As the van passes the powerless Cyclists, the side door
              swings open and the passenger window rolls down.  The group
              sticks their heads out and jeers and applauds.
 
              INT. VAN - DAY
 
              Chris turns on the radio -- Rock 'n Roll MUSIC blares as the
              lighthearted atmosphere returns.
 
              EXT. HIGHWAY
 
              Jauntily, the van zips down the highway.

              coming up over the hilly highway.
 
              The van turns off onto the dirt road and makes its way
              through a wooded landscape along a winding trail.  Sun
              dapples through the trees.

              EXT. LAKESIDE COTTAGE - DAY
 
              An overgrown driveway meanders among oak trees towards a
              rustic two-story house.  The oak trees have been there long
              before the house was built -- their heavy branches hang low,
              like tired arms, almost blocking the driveway.
 
              The house has an elevated porch and curtained windows.  It is
              in relatively decent condition though weatherbeaten and
              creates from the start an impression of family history.
 
              There is ample parking space before the house. On the left
              side of the driveway as one approaches, some thirty yards
              diagonally across from the house, there is a tall red barn
              with a hayloft equipped with a block and tackle (to bring up
              the bales of hay into the loft's square window).

              To the right of the house is an outhouse with a heartshaped
              venthole in its wooden door.
 
              To the left of the house is a large lake with a knotty old
              dock and a small tree-covered island in the middle.  The
              whole area is surrounded by a lush landscape.
 
              The SOUND of a VEHICLE approaching...
 
              The CAMERA reveals this serene, idyllic panorama and PICKS UP
              Chris' van as it bumps along the dirt road and slows down to
              a crawl to pass over a creaky, dilapidated wooden bridge that
              runs over a dried-up stream.
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              The CAMERA peers OVER-THE-SHOULDER of an UNIDENTIFIABLE
              FIGURE as he moves from one living room window to the other,
              watching the van as it sweeps under the low branches towards
              the house.
 
              EXT. HOUSE
 
              The van comes to a stop.  Chris jumps out and looks towards
              the house.  A collection of memories posses her for a moment
              before she reaches for the knotted rope and unties the tarp
              covering the bulk of the baggage on top.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (loud so the others
                                can hear)
                        Let's bring in the luggage first,
                        then I'll give you a tour of the
                        house and the barn and then we can
                        hang out at the lake... All right?
 
              No response.  Just the distant SOUND of FEET RUNNING and
              LAUGHTER.
 
              Chris walks around to the other side of the van and finds the
              doors left wide open and no one about.  She turns to see her
              friends running towards the lake, unable to resist the
              splendor of the shimmering water and sun dappled landscape.
 
              Debbie turns back and gestures for Chris to join them.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Come on down!
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (shaking her head)
                        You go ahead...

              In the background, behind Chris, the Shadowy Figure, OUT OF
              FOCUS, appears behind a curtain in the living room.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (to Debbie)
                        I'm gonna take my bags into the
                        house first and look around.
 
              Chris turns toward the house.  The Figure disappears from
              view.  Chris grabs a piece of baggage in each hand and
              innocently strides up the path and porch steps to the front
              door.
 
              It has been a while since she has last visited the family
              country home and she is actually pleased to have this moment
              to herself.
 
              She rifles through her handbag, comes up with the keys and
              reaches for the doorknob to find that the door is already
              open, ever so slightly.  A look of concern flashes across
              Chris' face.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (continuing)
                        Hello?
 
              Only the distant SOUNDS of her friends by the lake can be
              heard.
 
              Cautiously, Chris pushes the door.  Creaking, it opens wide.
              She hesitates a moment then takes a step inside.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (hearing a noise)
                        Who's there?
 
              From out of nowhere, a hand grabs Chris by the neck and pulls
              her OUT OF FRAME.  She SCREAMS!
 
              Then the SOUNDTRACK becomes coldly SILENT...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM / COTTAGE - DAY
 
              Pinned up against the wall, Chris is being embraced and
              kissed passionately by a MAN whose face is not yet visible.
 
              Resisting, Chris pushes him off.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Derek... stop.

                                  DEREK
                        Why?
 
              DEREK is 23, tall, dark and virile.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        You know what I've been through.
                        Don't ever scare me like that.
 
                                  DEREK
                        I'm sorry.  I just wanted to
                        surprise you.  What can I say?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (with a smile)
                        You can say... "Hello, how are
                        you?"... for starters.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (genuinely)
                        Hello.  How are you?
 
              He pulls her towards him to kiss her again.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (moving away)
                        You haven't changed a bit.  Always
                        so sure of yourself.  Even when we
                        were kids, when you wanted
                        something, nothing could stop you.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Is that so bad?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I don't know.
 
                                  DEREK
                        You're irresistible.  I lose
                        control.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Just slow down.  Let me get to
                        know you again.  Let me get to
                        know this place again.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Okay.  There's a whole weekend
                        ahead of us.  There's time.
 
              Chris embraces Derek.  Behind them, passing the porch
              windows, OUT OF FOCUS, is the shadowy figure of JASON.
              Neither Chris nor Derek is aware of the presence.

                                  CHRIS
                               (breaking the embrace)
                        Come outside and help me with the
                        bags.
 
              The turn and head for the front door.  Jason's figure moves
              away from the windows, out of sight.

              Chris and Derek bound down the porch steps to the van.

                        I'll get the bags off the top.
                        You get the ones inside.
 
              Chris moves around to the opposite side.  The sliding door
              which was previously wide open is now closed.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (unsure, talking out
                                loud)
                        This door was open just a minute
                        ago, wasn't it?
 
                                  DEREK (O.S.)

                                of the van)
                        What?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Nothing.
 
              The SOUND of the others thrashing about in the lake can be
              heard as Chris reaches for the handle and whisks the door
              aside.  Instinctively, she braces herself, but nothing jumps
              out at her.  Annoyed with herself for being so suspicious and
              jumpy, Chris just leans in and grabs for the first bag she
              sees.
 
              A HAND springs INTO FRAME and wraps around Chris' wrist.  She
              gasps and jumps back.
 
              Shelly sticks his head out the side of the van.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        That's my bag.  I'll take care of
                        it.

                                  CHRIS
                        What're you doing in there?  Why
                        aren't you down at the lake with
                        the others.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        'Cause they're skinny-dipping and
                        I'm not skinny enough.
 
              Chris looks toward the lake.

              Pitch black save for a slice of sunlight from an elevated
              basement window.  The door swings open.  Silhouetted in the
              doorway are Chili and Chuck just come from the lake, drenched
              and dripping in their wet clothing.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (uneasy)

                        That's the way it is, man.
                        Cellars are dark.
 
                                  CHUCK
                        And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin'
                        down there either.
 
              Chili flicks a wall switch next to her.  A naked light bulb
              springs to life, glowing dimly.
 
                                  CHILI
                        There's nothin' to be afraid of.
 
              She takes Chuck by the hand and leads him down the stairs.
              Their sneakers, sodden with water, squeak and squish as they
              go.  Water drips from their hair and clothes, forming little
              puddles that follow their every step.
 
              The basement is overrun with cobwebs and spiderwebs.  Rusted
              gardening tools, broken bicycle parts and boxes of old toys
              are strewn helter-skelter.  An old washer and dryer sit just
              to the left of the electrical fusebox.

                                  CHILI
                               (continuing)
                        Gimme your threads, man.
 
              Chuck pulls off his shirt and hands it to Chili.  She rings
              it out onto the floor creating a pool of water under the
              fusebox.
 
              As Chuck zips down his pants, Chili turns on the dryer.
              Annoyingly, the dryer RATTLES and SHAKES.
 
              Suddenly the light bulb goes off, plunging the twosome into
              near darkness.
 
              FOREBODING MUSIC enters the SOUNDTRACK...
 
                                  CHUCK
                        You broke the electricity, man!
 
              But yet, the dryer CLATTERS on.
 
              From over by the stairs, the SOUND of a METAL OBJECT being
              kicked against the door.
 
              Chili and Chuck whirl around to look.
 
              A rusty old roller skate bounces down the stairs and hits
              bottom with a CLUNK.
 
                                  CHUCK

              Laden with his and Debbie's baggage, Andy enters the front
              door, trudges to the base of the spiral staircase and looks
              up.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Whatever happened to equal rights
                        for men?
 
              Chris and Debbie, unburdened by luggage, reach the second
              floor landing.

                                  DEBBIE
                               (to Andy)
                        Stop bitching.  You can't expect
                        me to carry heavy things in my
                        condition.
 
              Andy grumbles and starts up the stairs.

              INT. BEDROOM - DAY
 
              Chris throws open the door and allows Debbie to enter first.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        This was my bedroom.  It's yours
                        for the weekend.
 
              Chris walks over to the windows and separates the curtains,
              flooding the room with light.  She opens the windows -- a
              cool breeze blows in.
 
              Debbie surveys the cheerful room with antique furniture that
              includes a folding.  Japanese-style dressing curtain.  But
              there is one important element missing in this bedroom...
              there's no bed.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Uh, Chris... I don't mean to be
                        picky, but... where do we sleep?
 
              With an impish smile, Chris goes over to the closet and pulls
              out a crumpled mass of netting.  She hands it to Debbie.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (perplexed)
                        What's this?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Your bed.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        A hammock?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Have you ever made love in a
                        hammock?
 
              Chris exits, closing the door behind her.

                                  DEBBIE
                               (envisioning the
                                pleasant
                                possibilities)
                        Hmmm... why not?
 
              Debbie begins to unravel the nylon mesh when suddenly, a gust
              of wind topples over the Japanese dressing curtain.  It hits
              the floor with a sharp SLAP.  At the same exact moment, the
              door is kicked open with a BANG, SLAMMING against the
              opposite wall.
 
              Debbie jumps.  It's Andy.  He squeezes through the door with
              the bulky baggage.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (looking around)
                        Where's the bed?
 
              With the back of his foot, Andy kicks the door to close it.
              An instant before the door slams shut, we SEE a fleeting yet
              ominous, glimpse of Jason behind Andy in the hallway.

              Chris in CLOSE SHOT, looks around the room, concerned about
              what she sees.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (calling out)
                        Derek, come in here!
 
              WIDER SHOT
 
              including the whole room.  The bed is a mess as if someone
              had slept in it recently, the closets are open -- hangers on
              the floor, some linen strewn about, the dresser drawers are
              pulled out and left hanging.
 
              Derek comes into the room carrying a box full of wooden
              paddles with little rubber balls attached by a long elastic
              thread.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Look what I found.  Remember these?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (her attention
                                focused elsewhere)
                        Did you stay here last night?

                                  DEREK
                               (looking around)
                        No.  I got here just before you
                        did.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Somebody was in here.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a
                        little strange to you?
 
              Chris begins straightening up the room, pushing in the
              drawers, etc.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Don't get paranoid.  I'm sure your
                        parents left it this way last time
                        they were here.  You know how
                        messy your father is.  If there
                        was a phone here, I'd call them up
                        right now.
 
              Derek moves over to help Chris make the bed.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        You have an answer for everything,
                        don't you?
 
              Derek shrugs his shoulders.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (gentle but firm)
                        I just think that it's about time
                        you stopped looking over your
                        shoulder, always expecting there's
                        someone coming after you.  That's
                        no way to live.
 
              Chris looks at Derek thoughtfully, but unconvinced.  They
              finish making the bed in silence.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. LAKE / COTTAGE - DAY
 
              Several six packs of empty beer bottles line a picnic table
              which is further cluttered with half-eaten sandwiches and the
              usual array of picnic goodies.

              Shelly and Vera sits across from each other, in the midst of
              a beer chugging contest.  Derek, Andy and Chuck sit on either
              side Shelly, encouraging him to victory.  Chris, Chili and
              Debbie, on either side of Vera, do likewise.
 
              Vera downs her next bottle with apparent ease.  Shelly balks
              as another beer is thrust in front of him.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (nauseous)
                        No more... I can't!
 
                                  ANDY
                        Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
 
              Shelly relents and suffers the beer as it goes down.  The
              accomplishment is met with a pat on the back.
 
              Vera, too, hesitates for a moment then chugs her beer, this
              time more slowly and with a degree of difficulty.
 
              Tipsy, Shelly rises to his feet.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (as if in control)
                        If you'll all please excuse me...
 
              Shelly picks up his small black suitcase and walks off on
              wobbly legs.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (yelling after him)
                        How could you let her beat you?
 
              SHELLY
 
              grabs his mouth and runs past the house into the outhouse,
              slamming the door behind him.
 
              The SOUNDS of Shelly vomiting can be heard.
 
              INT. OUTHOUSE
 
              Leaning over the hole, Shelly wipes his mouth with his
              sleeve.  Weakened and defeated, he sits down and leans his
              head back against the wall, closing his eyes.
 
              An OMINOUS TONE enters the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              From behind Shelly, the CAMERA MOVES past him and LOOKS OUT
              from the heart-shaped venthole carved in the door.

              From this distant vantage point, WE CAN SEE up to a second-
              floor window where a shadowy figure (Jason) looks down from
              behind a sheer curtain.
 
              SHELLY
 
              opens his eyes and listens to the others by the lake, having
              fun without him.  He stands up and OUT OF FRAME.
 
              EXT. OUTHOUSE
 
              Shelly comes out of the outhouse.  Alone with his black
              suitcase, he starts for the front door of the house.
 
              The OMINOUS TONE returns to the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              The CAMERA CRANES UP to the second-floor bedroom window where
              moments before the shadowy figure stood watching.  The figure
              is now gone from the window.  Only the curtains rustle in the
              breeze.
 
              The SOUND of the front door SLAMMING.  Shelly is inside.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. HOUSE - DAY
 
              CAMERA is behind Shelly as he ascends the spiral staircase.
              Halfway up, he HEARS a LOUD THUD.  Pausing to listen, he
              turns his face around, right into CAMERA.  He hears nothing
              further and continues up the stairs.
 
              When he reaches the landing, he HEARS SCREAMING coming from
              the lake.  He rushes into the bedroom which faces the water.
 
              INT. BEDROOM - DAY
 
              It's Andy and Debbie's bedroom where the hammock is now set
              up, draped with a bedspread.  Shelly looks out on the lake.
 
              SHELLY'S POV
 
              The SCREAMING is nothing more than playful activity.
 
              Suddenly, the SOUND of a window in the room SLAMMING shut.
              Startled, Shelly whips around to see the window beside the
              Japanese dressing curtain now closed.  Dust around the window
              has been unsettled.  The Japanese curtain wavers.  Shelly
              cannot see behind it.
 
              He edges over to the curtain and flings it aside.  There's
              nothing there.  He exits.

              INT. HALLWAY - DAY
 
              He walks to his room at the far end of the corridor and
              pushes on the door to open it.  It doesn't budge.  Leading
              with his shoulder, he bashes into the door.  This time it
              gives.  Shelly stumbles off-balance into the room (this is
              the same room which looks directly down on the outhouse)!
 
              A HIGH-PITCHED FOREBODING NOTE enters the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              Shelly takes a long look back down the hallway as he closes
              the door.
 
              CAMERA HOLDS for a moment on the closed door as the MUSICAL
              NOTE INTENSIFIES...

              A chilling, bloodcurdling SCREAM, from inside the house,
              shatters the calm by the lake.
 
                                  DEBBIE

              He leads the others in a race towards the house and up the
              porch steps.

              The group barrels into the house and assembles in the living

                        Are you all right, Shelly?
 
              Silence.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Let's spread out and check all the
                        rooms.  Outside, too.
                               (to Chris)
                        You stay with me.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        No.  I can look around by myself.
                        I'll take the upstairs.
 
              The group disperses.  The CAMERA STAYS with Chris.  She heads
              up the spiral staircase to the second-floor landing.
 
              INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
 
              She looks both ways down the corridor and sees Shelly's
              closed bedroom door at the end of the hall.  She approaches,
              tries the knob and pushes.  The door is stuck.  She kicks it
              open with her foot.  The door slams against the wall of the
              room.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (before going in)
                        Shelly...?
 
              The room is in order.  Chris takes a few hesitant steps
              inside, looking all around.  There's no trace of him.
 
              There are two closets in the room.  Chris reaches out for the
              nearest one and pulls open the door.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER...
 
              SHELLY
 
              An axe imbedded in his head, and bleeding profusely, falls
              forward into Chris' arms.  She SHRIEKS as Shelly's lifeless
              body slides down her arm and slumps to the floor.  Chris
              recoils, SCREAMING in horror.
 
              DEREK AND VERA
 
              burst into the room.

                        hell out of here.
 
              Andy and Debbie, followed by Chili and Chuck, rush into the
              room.  They react accordingly, except Andy.  He is curiously
              unaffected by the gruesome sight.  He bends down over Shelly.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Don't touch him!
 
              Undaunted, Andy places his hand on Shelly's stomach... and
              tickles him.  Shelly springs to life, giggling uncontrollably.
              The others gasp incredulously.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Get up, you creep.
 
              Shelly looks up at the angry mob.

                        you!
 
              Chris jumps Shelly and pummels him with punches.  The fake
              axe falls from his head as Shelly fends off Chris.  Derek
              grabs her and pulls her off.
 
                                  DEREK

                        You never mean to.
 
              Vera glares disdainfully at Shelly.  She finds him pitiful.

              The barn doors are wide open.
 
              The SOUND of an ENGINE CHOKING and SPUTTERING to life.  A
              rusted-out, old Volkswagen Beetle CHUGS out of the barn.
              Vera is driving.
 
              Cleaned all of his makeup and blood, Shelly races out of the
              house and runs alongside the VW, peering in at Vera.

                        away from here, too.
 
              Without a word, Vera zooms off, abandoning Shelly.  But when
              she reaches the bridge, she brakes and opens the passenger
              door.  Elated, Shelly bolts to the car and jumps in.

              Vera sneers at the woman and looks down the aisles for
              Shelly.  She finds him leafing through a magazine rack.
 
                                  VERA
                        Shelly... I need some money.
                        Throw me your wallet.
 
              Shelly digs into his pocket, comes up with the wallet and
              tosses it over to Vera.

              She reaches up to catch it, but it hits the side of her hand
              and drops to the floor.
 
              Vera bends down to pick it up, but someone beats her to it.
              A black hand with rings on each finger scoops the wallet up
              first.
 
              FOX... a Black woman outfitted in skin-tight black leather...
              holds the wallet.  Vera and she have an immediate and mutual
              dislike for each other.
 
              Flanking Fox, on either side, is ALI... a strapping Black man
              with a full set of gold teeth... and LOCO... sporting a

                        mine...
 
              Ali and Loco leer at Shelly and surround him.  They lift him
              off the ground, each grabbing an arm.

                        I'll take that, now.
 
              Fox continues rummaging through the wallet.  She pulls out a

              regains his feet.

              EXT. VOLKSWAGEN
 
              Vera slams on the brakes.  The car skids to a stop.  At the
              last possible moment, Fox steers her cycle deftly to the
              right of the VW.  Loco steers left. And, Ali jumps the car,
              flying over the top.
 
              As Ali lands on the highway, the three skid into a U-turn.

              VERA AND SHELLY
 
              open their eyes and look behind them.  Shelly braces himself
              as Vera guns the motor.
 
              EXT. CAR
 
              The car takes off.  The motorcycles are in pursuit.
 
              Ali easily catches up with the car and pulls up alongside the
              driver's window.  Loco creeps up on the passenger's side.
              Fox moves in behind the vehicle.
 
              ALI
 
              smiles at Vera.  The sun glints off his gold teeth.
 
              VERA
 
              smiles back.
 
              ALI
 
              whips out a heavy metal chain and smashes it through the
              windshield, right at CAMERA.  The windshield shatters.
 
              The car swerves out of control to the right, knocking into
              Loco, sending him and his cycle flying off the road.
 
              As Vera regains control of the VW, Ali drops back next to Fox
              behind the car.
 
              Ali hands Fox the chain and signals for her to move up the
              passenger side.
 
              INT. VW
 
              Shelly watches as Fox moves up alongside.
 
                                  VERA
                        Got any good ideas?
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Maybe.
 
              He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a bottle of
              champagne.
 
                                  VERA
                        This is no time to celebrate!
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Just keep your eyes on the road.

              Waving the chain menacingly, Fox pulls up alongside Shelly's
              window.
 
              Quickly, Shelly unravels the seal and shakes up the champagne
              bottle.
 
                                  VERA
                        What're you doing?
 
                                  SHELLY
                        No time to explain.  Just listen.
                        When I yell "stop," you jam on the
                        brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
 
                                  VERA
                               (pleased with
                                Shelly's initiative)
                        You're the boss.
 
              FOX
 
              hauls back with the chain and rams it through Shelly's
              window, barely missing her mark.
 
              SHELLY
 
              shakes the bottle as he pries up the plastic cork.
 
              FOX
 
              rears back with the chain and readies herself to strike a
              second time.
 
              Shelly aims the champagne bottle out the window.  With a
              final flick of his thumb the cork flies out and strikes Fox
              in the face -- a direct hit!
 
              Fox reaches for her face and falls backwards off her cycle.
 
                                  VERA
                        Bullseye!

                               (shouting)
                        Stop the car!  Now!!
 
              Vera jams on the brakes.
 
              EXT. VW
 
              The car comes to a screeching halt.

              ANGLE ON ALI
 
              shocked!  Unable to stop in time or swerve out of the way,
              his cycle runs right up the back of the car and flips over on
              top of him.
 
              The VW shifts into first gear and proceeds unimpeded.  Left
              in its wake are three motorcyclists sprawled out on the
              highway.

                        This has been on helluva beginning
                        to a quiet weekend in the country.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Look at it this way... things can
                        only get better... Right?

              EXT. COTTAGE / BARN - DAY
 
              The sun casts an orange glow over the landscape as it slowly
              sinks in the West.
 
              Andy is at one end of the porch working out -- strenuous
              calisthenics.  Chili and Chuck sit together on the porch
              swing, opposite Andy, sharing a joint.  They watch Andy's awe-
              inspiring performance as they rock back and forth.
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Maybe we should do some exercise.
 
                                  CHILI
                        This is all the exercise I need...
 
              She raises the joint to her mouth and tokes on it.
 
              In the background, Debbie comes jogging out of the woods,
              over to the small bridge and towards the house.  Behind her,
              the war-torn Volkswagen Beetle winds its way down the dirt
              road.  Debbie turns and jogs backwards as the car approaches.
 
              Chili, Chuck and Andy see the car coming. The damage is
              evident even from a distance.  They run from the porch as the
              VW passes Debbie and comes to a halt just in front of the
              barn.
 
              Chili, Chuck, Andy and Debbie surround the car.  Chuck puts
              his hand through the frame of the windshield and touches
              Vera's face.

                                  CHUCK
                        Where's your windshield, man?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        What happened to you guys?  Are
                        you all right?
 
                                  ANDY
                        The question is... is the beer all
                        right?
 
              Shelly and Vera grab the bags and get out of the car.  They
              hand the packages to Chili and Chuck.
 
                                  VERA
                        We had a slight misunderstanding
                        with that motorcycle gang...
                               (she puts her arm
                                around Shelly)
                        ... but Shelly made them see the
                        error of their ways.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (heroically)
                        It was nothing.
 
              Together, Shelly and Vera head for the house.  Andy and
              Debbie linger by the car.
 
              BARN
 
              Through the musty darkness, a HULKING HAND reaches out and
              stealthily pushes open the creaky barn door.  It's Jason.  He
              peeks through the crack and watches the group.
 
              DEREK AND CHRIS
 
              come running out of the house.  Derek is dumbfounded at the
              sight of his abused and battered car.
 
                                  DEREK
                        My beautiful car!  What'd you do
                        to it?!
 
              Vera and Shelly pass him on their way to the porch.
 
                                  VERA
                               (hanging Derek the
                                keys)
                        We're really sorry, but it wasn't
                        our fault.

                                  SHELLY
                        A few minor repairs and it'll be
                        as good as new.
 
              Derek runs up to his car.  Chris follows.  Shelly and Vera go
              inside the house.  Chili and Chuck follow behind, carrying
              the packages in.
 
              The barn door slowly closes, unseen by anyone.
 
              DEREK
 
              examines the injuries sustained by his car.
 
                                  DEREK
                        This is too painful to look at.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Why don't we drive over to the
                        cove and watch the sunset.  It'll
                        mellow you out.
 
              Derek considers it for a moment.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Might be nice to get away from
                        these crazy friends of yours.
 
              They jump into the car.  The CAMERA PANS with the VW as it
              drives off, revealing Andy and Debbie leaning against a tree,
              kissing.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Why don't we go take a swim?
 
                                  ANDY
                        I don't know...
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (seductively)
                        We'd be all alone.  We could do
                        anything we wanted and nobody
                        would see.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
 
              He grabs Debbie by the hand and runs with her towards the
              lake.  As they run past the van, Debbie breaks away from Andy.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        You go ahead.  I'm gonna get a
                        blanket.

              Andy continues to the lake, walking on his hands when he
              reaches the dock.
 
              VAN
 
              Debbie slides open the side door and crawls inside.
 
              OMINOUS MUSIC invades the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              A pair of DARK BOOTED FEET approach furtively.
 
              Debbie's rear end is practically sticking out as the boots
              sneak around the back of the van and edge their way towards
              her.
 
              Abruptly, Debbie backs down out of the vehicle, blanket in
              hand, and scampers away without seeing the prowler.
 
              PROWLER
 
              CAMERA TILTS UP from the boots to reveal... Ali, the Black
              motorcyclist.  He's carrying an empty gas can and a siphon.
              His eyes scan the area.  There's no one on sight -- Debbie is
              already down by the lake.
 
              He signals with his hands and out from the bushes come Loco
              and Fox.  They scurry over to the van and duck down next to
              Ali who is unscrewing the van's gas cap.
 
                                  FOX
                        Maybe we shouldn't do this, Ali.
 
                                  LOCO
                        We gotta even the score, don't we?
 
                                  ALI
                               (to Fox)
                        Nobody's gonna get hurt, baby.
 
              Ali sticks the siphon down into the fuel tank and lays the
              gas can on the ground below it.  Loco tries to grab the
              siphon from Ali.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (over anxious)
                        Let me do it.
 
                                  ALI
                               (authoritative)
                        I know what I'm doing.
 
              Fox's attention is drawn to the barn as her cohorts continue
              with the task at hand.

              BARN
 
              Fox cautiously pulls open one of the two doors.  It CREAKS
              loudly.  She stops and looks around to see if anyone has
              heard -- the coast is clear.  She slips into the barn and
              pulls the door closed behind her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BARN - DUSK
 
              Spears of fading sunlight, thick with dust, cut across the
              musty interior.
 
              Fox scans the premises.  Her face lights up with the smile of
              a child in a toy store trying to decide which area to explore
              first.
 
              This is your typical barn with a variety of heavy duty tools,
              some rusting; saw horses; wooden benches and ladders; a horse
              stall; haybins, haystacks and a second floor hayloft; and,
              several storage rooms.
 
              With the fascination of a street kid who has probably never
              seen the inside of a barn, Fox wanders through the rustic
              interior.  In her high-heeled boots, she has trouble
              maneuvering around on the muddy, hay covered floor.
 
              As she approaches the toolshed, one of her heels sticks deep
              into a sticky patch of mud and she falls forward off-balance.
              To stop her fall, Fox reaches out for the toolshed handle.
              She grabs it but the rotting old door tears off its hinges
              and she topples to the ground -- her face landing inches away
              from a pitchfork's prongs aiming upwards at her.
 
              Her eyes focus on the sharp teeth of the pitchfork.  Alarmed
              by the close call, Fox tosses the implement away, gets up and
              dusts herself off.
 
              Looking skyward to the loft area, Fox moves over to its
              ladder and starts up.  The ladder quivers as she ascends,
              apparently dislodging a bale of hay at the top and sending it
              crashing towards her.  (Or, was it Jason?)  Fox swings her
              body out of the way just in time.  The bale whizzes by her
              and hits the barn floor with a THUD.
 
              She continues up the ladder and disappears through the loft
              flooring.

              Ali and Loco have just completed filling up one gas can and
              are starting to fill the second one.  Ali sticks the siphon
              in his mouth and draws on it.  The gas begins to flow as Loco
              shoves the container into place to catch all the fluid.
 
              The SOUND of Fox wailing like a wounded animal...
 
              Ali and Loco spin around and look up.
 
              POV OF BARN
 
              Fox comes swinging out, Tarzan-like, from the hayloft on the
              rope attached to the block and tackle.  She's having a hell
              of a good time.

              ALI AND LOCO
 
              watch her incredulously.
 
                                  ALI
                               (shouting in a loud
                                whisper)
                        Quiet, woman!  Get off that thing!
 
              FOX
 
              disappears from view through the square opening in the loft.
              A second later, she reappears, swinging out on the rope again.
 
                                  FOX
                        But it feels so goooooood...!
 
              She swings back and disappears from view once more.
 
              ALI
 
              is not pleased.
 
                                  ALI
                        You're getting me pissed-off, Fox.
                        We got work to do.
 
              BARN
 
              This time the rope swings out from the loft... without Fox
              attached.  There's a dead silence.  The rope dangles.

                                  ALI
                               (to Loco)
                        Go get her out of there.
 
              Loco hunches over, keeping his body low to the ground as he
              high-tails it to the barn and zips inside.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BARN - DUSK
 
              Loco advances deeper into the barn, his eyes looking
              everywhere.
 
              It's getting darker, minute by minute.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (agitated)
                        Fox... where are ya!?
 
              No response.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (continuing)
                        Stop foolin' around.  You're
                        screwin' up everything.
 
              Still no response.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (continuing)
                        Shit!
 
              He hears the SOUND of banging against the wall of the loft
              above him.  He starts up the ladder.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (continuing)
                        You've had it now, woman!  I'm mad!
 
              LOFT
 
              Loco comes through the opening and steps onto the floorboard.
              The deep shadows hide the corners of the loft and Loco has to
              squint his eyes to see.
 
              Right behind him, he hears the SOUND of the banging again.  He
              whips around...
 
              MUSICAL STINGER...
 
              In front of him, Fox's body, raised off the ground and
              impaled with a pitchfork through her and into the wall.

              Her eyes are open wide with a deathly stare while her feet
              kick against the wall with final spasms of life.  Blood flows
              from the penetrations in her torso.
 
              The horrific sight is even too much for Loco.  He gags and
              grasps his mouth with his hand, choking back a scream.
 
              He turns to run...
 
              Another MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Loco's face registers shock and horror as he runs smack into
              the teeth of an onrushing pitchfork being thrust at him.
 
              He cringes and gurgles up blood as the prongs are jammed
              through his stomach and out his back.
 
              He staggers, the pitchfork handle sticking straight out of
              his gut.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. BARN - DUSK
 
              Carrying the two jugs of gasoline, one in each hand, Ali is
              just outside the barn doors.  To gain entrance, he kicks on
              the doors and looks around to see if anyone has heard him.
              He waits for one of the two to let him in.
 
              POV OF LAKE
 
              Andy and Debbie frolic by the waterfall, oblivious to the
              murderous goings-on.
 
              ALI
 
              still waiting to be let in.  He kicks on the door again.
 
                                  ALI
                               (loud whisper)
                        Loco... Fox... Open this damn door.
 
              Frustrated by the lack of response from inside, Ali puts one
              can down and pries open the door for himself.  He fumbles his
              way inside.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BARN - DUSK
 
              Ali closes the door behind him and immediately hears
              FOOTSTEPS CLOMPING around above him in the hayloft.

                                  ALI
                        What the hell are you two doin' up
                        there?
 
              He rages over to the ladder and looks up.  His eyes widen and
              mouth drops open.  Directly above him, Loco, the pitchfork
              still protruding from his stomach, falls through the opening
              in the loft floor, right at Ali.
 
              The two crash to the barn floor, together.  Ali throws Loco's
              body off of him and struggles to his feet.  He backs away,
              fixated on Loco's engorged corpse and cries out for Fox -- a
              deep, moanful bellow.
 
              The CAMERA DOLLIES quickly into a CLOSE SHOT on his face.
              His eyes focus directly in front of him as he SCREAMS right
              into CAMERA.  It's Jason!
 
                                  ALI
                               (trembling)
                        Noooo!
 
              Ali turns and makes a mad dash for the door.  In his panic,
              he trips over one of the gas cans.  Frantically, he crawls on
              his hands and knees to the door.
 
              He reaches to pull himself up by the door and a large monkey
              wrench comes smashing down on the side of his face, bashing
              in his skill.  He slumps to the floor.
 
              In the distance, Andy and Debbie's voices can be heard
              approaching.
 
              From behind Jason, the CAMERA MOVES with him to a side window
              and peers out.
 
              Through the window, we SEE Andy and Debbie, wrapped in the
              blanket, coming up from the lake.  They're wet and dripping.
              Andy pulls Debbie along with him, towards the barn.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        What're you doing?
 
                                  ANDY
                        We haven't looked in the barn,
                        yet.  Let's take a look.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (stopping)
                        Not now.  I'm cold.
 
              Andy moves right up to the grimy window.  Shading his eyes,
              he peeks inside.  He seems to be looking right at Jason (and
              CAMERA), but he apparently doesn't see him.

                                  ANDY
                               (to Debbie)
                        How about a roll in the hay?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        You can play with yourself, 'cause
                        I'm going in the house.
 
              She turns back towards the house.  Andy lingers for a moment
              then catches up with Debbie.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM / HOUSE - NIGHT
 
              The front door swings open, Debbie and Andy take one step
              in... and duck!
 
              ANDY AND DEBBIE'S POV
 
              A couple of little, red rubberballs spring straight at them
              (and CAMERA), retract quickly and pulsate at them again.
 
              It's SHELLY, a paddleball in each hand.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Cut it out!
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Can't stop now.
 
              Andy looks into the living room.  Vera, Chili and Chuck are
              engaged in the same child's play.  Each wallops a little
              rubberball in their own inimitable style.
 
                                  VERA
                               (adept)
                        Ninety six... ninety seven...
                        ninety eight... ninety nine... one
                        hundred...
 
              She continues without faltering.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (fumbling)
                        One hundred... ninety nine...
                        ninety eight...
 
              He misses and tries again.  Chili is hitting the ball as if
              she were serving in a tennis match.  It's a veritable were
              ring circus.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Who brought up this bright idea?

                                  SHELLY
                               (concentrating on the
                                game)
                        We were looking for something to
                        keep our hands busy.  It was
                        either this or an orgy.  Vera
                        chose this.
                               (resigned)
                        What're ya gonna do?
 
              The fireplace is raging with a full-bodied, crackling flame.
              Debbie drags Andy over to the box of paddle rackets in front
              of the fireplace and hands one to him.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        How about you and I whacking a
                        couple of balls around?
 
                                  ANDY
                        If you insist.
 
              They join the others.  Rubberballs are flying from all
              directions (at CAMERA).
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. COVE / LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Derek's VW is parked just off the road overlooking the cove
              not far from the water.
 
              Derek flicks on the car's headlights.  They gleam right into
              CAMERA.
 
              CHRIS
 
              is standing at the water's edge, backlit by the headlight
              beams.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (approaching)
                        Is that better?
 
              Chris nods and sits on the shore, looking out at water.  She
              rubs the chill from her body.  Derek takes off his jean
              jacket and puts it around Chris' shoulders.  He sits down
              beside her.
 
              Derek tosses pebbles across the shimmering water.  Moonlight
              glints like little stars off the ripples.
 
              After an uncomfortable silence, Derek looks over at Chris.
              Silhouetted by the light, Chris' profile is accentuated in
              all its vulnerability and sensuality.

              He puts his arm around her.  She tenses up.  Derek wants to
              kiss her, but doesn't.
 
                                  DEREK
                        You know, I'm not sure I could
                        live anywhere else.  The nights
                        are always so peaceful and quiet.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        It's deceiving.
 
                                  DEREK
                        What do you mean?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        The quiet can fool you.  It fooled
                        me.  You can never be sure of
                        what's out there.
 
              Frustrated, Derek stands up and moves to the edge of the
              water, picking up handfuls of pebbles and throwing them.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (without looking at
                                Chris)
                        Why did you come back here?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (hesitating)
                        ... To prove something to
                        myself... to prove I'm stronger
                        than I think I am.
 
                                  DEREK
                        And, what about us?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I'm here with you.  Can't that be
                        enough for now?
 
                                  DEREK
                        I don't know.  I don't see you for
                        months on end, and when I do, you
                        put this wall between us.  How do
                        I break through?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
 
              Derek sits down next to her, again.  There's momentary
              silence.
 
                                  DEREK
                        What happened that night?

                                  CHRIS
                        You promised you'd never ask me.
 
                                  DEREK
                        After you left me that night, I
                        didn't see you or talk to you
                        again for a year.  No one would
                        tell me anything.  All I know is
                        what the police told me.
                               (leaning in to her)
                        We have nowhere to go unless you
                        let me in.
                               (pausing)
                        What happened?
 
              Chris looks into Derek's eyes.

              INT. LIVING ROOM / HOUSE - NIGHT
 
              The SOUND of a rubberball hitting the paddle racket with a
              constant, even rhythm.
 
              IN CLOSE-up, the CAMERA PANS the staring bored faces of
              Chili, Chuck, Vera, Shelly and Debbie until it stop of the
              intense, concentrating face of Andy -- the elastic and
              rubberball pass his face again and again.
 
                                  ANDY
                        ... One thousand twelve... one
                        thousand thirteen... one thousand
                        fourteen... What's the World's
                        Record for this?
 
                                  SHELLY
                        According to the Guinness Book,
                        you passed the World's Record
                        several whacks ago.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (genuinely excited)
                        I did?!  I broke the world's
                        record.
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Who cares, man?!
 
                                  ANDY
                        I do.
 
              He stops whacking the ball.  The others sigh with relief.

                                  ANDY
                               (continuing)
                        You're all just jealous.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Actually, I have no idea what the
                        World's Record is.  I was just
                        kidding.
 
              The others laugh.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Think you're funny?  Well, I'll
                        just have to start all over again.
 
              The whole group jumps Andy and wrestles the paddle away from
              him.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Well, what do we do now?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (taking Andy by the
                                hand)
                        Come on, Champ, I think you and I
                        can find something to do.
 
              Andy, dutifully and happily, follows Debbie up the winding
              staircase.
 
                                  CHILI
                               (to Chuck)
                        Remember that strange looking
                        plant we saw outside.  Let's go
                        smoke it.
 
              Chuck follows Chili out the back door.
 
              Shelly looks around.  Vera is the only other person in the
              room.  They stare at each other, then look away.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        I guess that leaves you and me.
 
              Awkward silence.  Shelly gets a very determined look on his
              face like his is going to ask Vera something he has never
              asked a woman before.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (sincere)
                        Vera... you and I have had a
                        chance to really get to know one
                        another today.  I like you... very
                        much.  I was thinking that maybe.

                                  VERA
                               (quickly interrupting)
                        Don't say any more.
 
              Shelly drops his head, dejected.
 
                                  VERA
                               (continuing)
                        I'm going outside for a few
                        minutes.  We'll talk when I get
                        back.
 
              She turns away and goes out the front door.  Shelly moves
              over to the living room window and watches her.
 
              EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
 
              Vera ambles down the porch steps and when she reaches the
              front walk, she surveys the surroundings and breathes deeply.
 
              SHELLY - INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              watches Vera stroll away.  His disappointment is sketched all
              over his face.  He turns away from the window and moves over
              to the fireplace, looking into the flame.
 
              FOREBODING MUSIC...
 
              Jason's dark, hulking frame moves into THE SHOT as he looks
              through the window at Shelly.
 
              Shelly pokes aimlessly at the hot ambers, his back to the
              window, unaware of the lurking Jason.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 
              Andy and Debbie are locked in each other's arms in front of
              the hammock.
 
                                  ANDY
                        How do we do it?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (deadpan)
                        First we take off our clothes,
                        then you get on top of me or I get
                        on top of you...
 
                                  ANDY
                        I know how to do it.  I mean, how
                        do we do it in the hammock?

              Without a word, Debbie removes her top garment.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Think you can figure it out?
 
                                  ANDY
                               (staring at her
                                breasts)
                        I'll think of something.
 
              He wraps his arms around Debbie and fervently kisses her.

              CHRIS AND DEREK
 
              sitting on shore, close together, somber.  The headlight
              beams have dimmed.  The dark, desolate landscape looms around
              them.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I had never made love to anybody
                        before that night. You made it so
                        special, I hope it would always be
                        like that for us.
 
              The CAMERA begins to dolly slowly -- ever so slowly -- around
              Derek and Chris.
 
              **OPTIONAL:  The following dialogue may be used as a narration
                           over a FLASHBACK SEQUENCE.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        When you dropped me off at the
                        house, it was very late.  My
                        parents were waiting up for me.
                        As soon as I got in the door, they
                        starting yelling and cursing at
                        me.  I was so upset... I told them
                        I slept with you.  My mothers
                        slapped me.  That was the first
                        time she'd ever hit me.  I
                        couldn't believe it.  I ran out of
                        the house and into the woods as
                        fast and as far as I could run.
                        I was crying.  They had destroyed
                        the most beautiful night of my
                        life and I wanted to punish them
                        for that.  I decided to hide out
                        all night.  They'd be so worried 
                        that they'd be sorry for what they
                        did to me.  The woods were cold and
                        damp from the rain.  I found a dry
                        spot under a rotted oak tree and I
                        guess I fell asleep.
                               (takes a deep breath)
                        All I can remember next is being
                        startled out of sleep by the sound
                        of footsteps.  I thought it was my
                        father so I hid behind the tree.
                        But the footsteps just stopped.
                        The woods were dark.  I couldn't
                        see anything.
                               (intensifying)
                        I heard a cracking noise behind
                        me.  I turned around and... and...
                        oh, God... there was this hideous
                        looking man.  So grotesque he was
                        almost inhuman.  He had a knife
                        and he started to slash away at
                        me, again and again.  I was so
                        hysterical and I don't know how I
                        was able to get away.  I ran and
                        ran, but he kept coming.  He was
                        big but so fast.  He caught me and
                        pulled me down to the ground and
                        he... he... ripped my blouse off.
                        I was screaming, but who could
                        hear me?  Then... oh, God... he
                        dragged me by the hair along the
                        ground.  I was kicking and
                        yelling.  He dragged me deeper and
                        deeper into the woods.  Oh,
                        please... please...
 
                                  DEREK
                               (stroking her)
                        It's all right, you're all right.
                        I'm with you.

                                  CHRIS
                        I... I don't know what happened
                        after that.  I must have fainted
                        because the next thing I knew I
                        would talk about it.  And I never
                        have.  Not until now.  I just
                        wanted to forget.  But I can't.
                        I'll never forget that horrible
                        face.  Never.
 
              The car headlights suddenly snap off.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (alarmed)
                        Who's there?
 
              They look around.  There's no one in sight.
 
                                  DEREK
                        It's the battery, damnit.
 
              The two run up to the car.  Derek jumps in and tries to start
              it.  The engine WHIRS but won't turn over.  Chris looks
              apprehensively at Derek.  He grabs a flashlight from the
              glove compartment, flicks it on and gets out of the car.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (taking Chris' hand)
                        It's no problem.  We'll just walk
                        back.
 
              Hand-in-hand, the two start down the wooded path.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              CAMERA SHOOTS over the waterfall towards the dock.  Vera
              strolls down the wooded platform -- the old boards CREAK
              beneath her.
 
              Only the flowing water can be heard as a darkened,
              indistinguishable FIGURE ENTERS FRAME -- directly in front of
              CAMERA -- and lowers himself all the way into the lake by the
              waterfall.
 
              Vera rolls her pant legs up to her knees.  She dangles her
              long legs over the dock.  Her toes break the surface of the
              water, SWOOSHING it back and forth.
 
              LAKE
 
              Air bubbles rise to the top.  Vera does not see the darkened
              figure as he swims beneath the surface of the water.
 
              The night is a symphony of sounds:  crickets SCRATCHING en
              masse, branches and leaves FLUTTERING in the evening breeze,
              water LAPPING at the shore.

              UNDERWATER POV
 
              of Vera.  She leans back, her arms bent behind her, her face
              arched upwards.
 
              VERA'S FEET
 
              kick back and forth SPLASHING the water.  Air bubbles mark
              the trail of the approaching underwater figure.
 
              Vera breathes in.  The sensuous serenity deeply relaxes her.
              She begins to softly sing a song form her childhood in
              Spanish.
 
              UNDERWATER POV
 
              Vera's feet are an arms length away, kicking towards the
              CAMERA LENS.  She finishes her song and lays back...
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              The figure jumps out of the water and grabs Vera's leg and
              pulls her.  Vera SCREAMS and lurches forward, almost sliding
              off the dock.  She reaches out and clings to the side.
 
              The figure holds her calves and tugs harder.  Vera's grasp is
              slipping.  She tries to kick him off.
 
              Suddenly, the figure releases her limbs and submerges
              underwater.
 
              Vera pulls herself back up onto the dock.
 
              Clad in a black scuba suit and white faceless mask, the
              rotund figure rises out of the water onto the shore.  In one
              hand he holds a small spear-gun.  With the other, he removes
              his mask.  It's Shelly!
 
              Vera glares at him.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        You've just learned a valuable
                        lesson.  A beautiful girl like you
                        should never go out in the dark
                        alone.
 
                                  VERA
                        Damn you, Shelly!
 
              Vera stomps off the dock towards him.  Shelly retracts.
 
                                  VERA
                               (continuing)
                        Why do you do these stupid things?!

                                  SHELLY
                               (looking away)
                        I have to.
 
                                  VERA
                        You don't "have to."
 
                                  SHELLY
                        I just want you to like me.
 
                                  VERA
                        I do like you.  But not when you
                        act like a jerk.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Being a jerk is better than being
                        nothing.
 
                                  VERA
                        I never said you were "nothing".
 
                                  SHELLY
                        You don't to say it.  I can tell.
 
                                  VERA
                        You're wrong.
 
              Shelly hangs his head and says nothing further.  He just
              walks off towards the house.
 
                                  VERA
                               (sympathetic)
                        Hey... I'll be in, in a little
                        while.  We can talk some more.
 
              EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
 
              Shelly trudges up the front walk to the porch and plops
              himself down on the porch swing, still clutching the mask and
              spear-gun.
 
              In a contemplative mood, he slowly swings back and forth.
              The taut metal chains that support the swing, vibrate and
              CREAK in a steady rhythm.
 
              Shelly looks down at the lake.
 
              SHELLY'S SWINGING POV
 
              Vera sits back down on the dock, facing away from the house.

              SHELLY
 
              is alerted to what sounds like the cry of a wounded animal
              emanating from the barn.  He looks over and sees a shadow
              cross in front of one of the windows.  The cry continues.
 
              Shelly jumps off the swing and heads for the barn with his
              mask and spear-gun at his side.
 
              EXT. BARN - NIGHT
 
              Shelly comes up to the window and looks in.  It's too dark to
              see anything.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (rapping on the
                                window)
                        Chuck?  Chili?  What're you guys
                        doing in there?
 
              He hears RUMBLING inside, but no response.  He moves to the
              front doors and pries them open.
 
              INT. BARN - NIGHT
 
              Shelly comes in and fumbles for the light switch.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        You guys doin' somethin' I
                        shouldn't see?
 
              He finds the switch and FLICKS on the light.  The very moment
              the light goes on, an OWL swoops down and aims straight for
              his head (and CAMERA).  Shelly drops the spear-gun and the
              mask to thwart off the bird with his hands.  The owl flies
              out of the partially open barn doors.  Shelly quickly closes
              them.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. LAKE / DOCK - NIGHT
 
              Vera is pacing, back and forth, on the dock.  She stops at
              the far edge and peers into the water.
 
              VERA'S POV
 
              Floating by is a woman's bra (probably, Debbie's).
 
              Vera smirks as she lies prone on the boards and reaches with
              her hand, grabbing the undergarment and rescuing it from the
              lake.

              She leans back into a kneeling position and rings out the
              soggy bra.  Her heels dig into the rear pocket of her jeans,
              pushing a wallet out of the pocket onto the dock.  Vera
              reaches behind her and picks it up.  It's Shelly's wallet --
              the one he gave her at the liquor store.
 
              Leafing through the contents, Vera finds his driver's license
              and a photograph of Shelly and his mother.
 
              She looks around.  Shelly is nowhere in sight.  Assuming he
              has returned to the house, she gets up to look for him -- as
              she rises, her hand knocks against the dock.  The wallet
              slips out her her grasp and bounces into the lake.
 
                                  VERA
                               (watching the wallet
                                sink)
                        That's just great!
 
              After a moment of deliberation, she takes off her shoe and
              plunges into the water, diving after the billfold.
 
              She swims around underneath the surface, searching with her
              hands.  She rises for air periodically.
 
              She submerges deeper than the previous attempts.  Air bubbles
              rising to the surface, establish her whereabouts -- a good
              distance from the shore.
 
              She comes up for air once more, empty-handed.
 
              VERA'S POV
 
              the dock.  A dark figure, wearing Shelly's white mask and
              holding the spear-gun, kneels at the edge of the pier.
 
              From the water, at this distance, Vera easily mistakes the
              figure (Jason) for Shelly.
 
                                  VERA
                               (waving to the
                                figure, shouting)
                        Hey... I dropped your wallet!  I'm
                        sorry!
 
              She starts to breast stroke toward him.
 
              OMINOUS MUSIC throbs on the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              Jason raises the spear-gun to eye level.
 
              Vera swims unknowingly toward her demise.  A few yards from
              the dock, she glides right into Shelly's floating wallet.

              Jason aims the spear-gun.
 
              Vera, grabbing the wallet, she treads water and raises it
              triumphantly over her head for "Shelly" to see.
 
                                  VERA
                               (continuing)
                        I found it!
 
              She looks up to see the spear-gun pointed right at her head
              (and CAMERA).
 
                                  VERA
                               (panicked)
                        What're you doing?  Who are you?!
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Jason pulls the trigger, releasing the spear.  With a WHOOSH,
              the arrow penetrates Vera's skull.  A look of unmitigated
              disbelief on Vera's face as she sinks into the water.  Blood
              seeps to the surface.
 
              LONG SHOT
 
              of lake and dock.  Jason, in the distance, his back to
              CAMERA, just stands at the edge of the pier looking down into
              the bloody water.
 
              CAMERA PANS over to the house and CRANES UP to a second floor
              bedroom window, glowing from candlelight, and peers in.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 
              The room is darkened save for pools of light emanating from
              several candles -- one in each window, the others on the
              opposite side of the room -- lending an atmosphere of warmth
              and intimacy.
 
              CAMERA DOLLIES IN towards the hammock which wildly rocks bath
              and forth accompanied by the sounds of lovemaking.
 
              Debbie and Andy are not visible in full -- only glimpses of
              their naked limbs and torsos can be seen above the curved
              side of the hammock.  Blankets and sheets hang sloppily over
              the edges to the floor.
 
              CAMERA continues to DOLLY IN as the SOUNDS grow more heated
              until Debbie and Andy are FRAMED in a TWO SHOT as they climax.
 
              The thrashing about stops and the hammock slows down to a
              gentle swaying.

                                  DEBBIE
                        That was the best yet.  Was it
                        you... me... or the hammock?
 
                                  ANDY
                        I vote for me.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        I vote for the hammock.
 
              Debbie attempts to get out of the hammock.  It's not a simple
              move -- she nearly falls to the floor taking Andy with it.
 
                                  ANDY
                        I'm seasick.  Get in or get out of
                        the boat.
 
              Debbie gets out.  She heads into the bathroom and flicks on
              the light -- bright and a strain to the eyes.  She turns on
              the shower.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (loud)
                        What're you doin'?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (poking her head back
                                in)
                        I think it's called "a shower".
                        You might try it sometime.
 
                                  ANDY
                        You're too clean for me.
 
              Debbie responds by closing the door.
 
              INT. STAIRCASE / HALLWAY
 
              FOREBODING MUSIC pierces the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              Displaying a thick-bladed machete, Jason ascends the spiral
              stairs.  Andy can be heard off-screen calling loudly to
              Debbie in the shower.
 
                                  ANDY (O.S.)
                        Hey Deb... can you hear me?
 
                                  DEBBIE (O.S.)
                               (from bathroom)
                        Barely.

                                  ANDY (O.S.)
                               (louder)
                        I'm going downstairs to get a
                        beer. You want one?
 
                                  DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        What?
 
              Jason reaches the landing at the top of the stairs and
              disappears into the shadows.
 
              INT. BATHROOM
 
              Behind the sheer curtain, Debbie's naked silhouette can be
              seen lathering herself in the shower.
 
              SHOWER
 
              Debbie luxuriates in the soap and hot water.
 
              Distorted through the plastic curtain, the door opens.
 
              Debbie remains blissfully unaware as she soaps her face.  She
              hears a BANGING NOISE.  Her eyes are closed due to the soap
              and shower spray.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Andy?
 
              No response.  Concerned, Debbie turns off the water and wipes
              the soap from her eyes.
 
              Looking up, she sees a shadowy figure poised in front of the
              curtain.  Quickly, she reaches out and rips the curtain
              aside...
 
              Staring her in the face is a pair of men's feet and jean-
              covered legs.  It's Andy, walking on his hands.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (upside-down)
                        Do you want a beer or not?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (relieved)
                        Sure.
 
              Andy turns himself around and handwalks out of the bathroom.
 
                                  ANDY
                        I'll be back in a minute.
 
              Debbie jumps out of the tub and shuts the door.  She returns
              to the shower and turns the water back on.

                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BEDROOM / HALLWAY - NIGHT
 
              CLOSE SHOT on Andy upside-down.  CAMERA MOVES with him as he
              hand-steps out of the bedroom.  He WHISTLES an upbeat tune as
              he goes.
 
              An OMINOUS TONE enters the SOUNDTRACK, a haunting counterpoint
              to Andy's WHISTLING.
 
              Jason's hulking frame is braced up against the wall in the
              hallway corridor at the entrance to the bedroom.  Andy is
              unaware of Jason's presence as he hand-walks right past his
              boots towards the staircase.
 
              Off-screen, Debbie calls out to Andy over the SOUND of the
              shower.
 
                                  DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        Andy... Are you still out there?
 
              At the head of the stairs, Andy stops and pivots around 180
              degrees, turning head-on into Jason's boots.  Surprised, he
              looks up.
 
              ANDY'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV
 
              of Jason in Shelly's white mask.  A machete is poised above
              his head.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Before Andy can react, the machete is thrust down between his
              legs, slicing through his upside-down body.  Andy's ghastly
              SCREAM reverberates as he topples backwards down the spiral
              stairs.
 
              Jason retrieves his body.  He drags Andy's halved corpse up
              the stairs and back into the bedroom, closing the door behind
              him.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              With the shower running full blast, the door closed, and
              HUMMING to herself, Debbie remains oblivious to the sounds of
              the murderous activities.  She rinses her hair and turns off
              the faucet.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES slowly IN CLOSE on Debbie as she steps but
              of the tub and dries herself off.

              She hears a CRASHING SOUND that seems to have come from the
              bedroom.  She stands still and listens.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Andy?  You can have my beer.  I
                        don't want it.
 
              Humming again, she wraps herself in her robe and swings the
              bathroom door open.
 
              INT. BEDROOM
 
              The room is quiet, untouched.  Andy is nowhere in sight.
              Debbie shrugs it off, moves to the bedroom door, opens it and
              sticks her head out.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (calling downstairs)
                        Andy, don't bring me a beer.  Do
                        you hear me?
 
              She stays at the door for a moment listening for Andy.  Behind
              her, in the bedroom, Jason creeps across room.  Debbie is
              unaware.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (continuing)
                        Andy!  Answer me!  I hate when you
                        do that.
 
              She SLAMS the door shut!  Peeved at Andy, she picks up a book
              (Stephen King's newest novel) from a table and rolls into the
              hammock top of the covers which hang all the way to the floor.
 
              She settles in.  The hammock sways slightly.  She finds her
              place in the book and playing with her damp hair, she starts
              to read.
 
              Quite unexpectedly from above her, a large drop of blood
              falls and splatters all over the white pages of her book.
              Alarmed, she touches the fluid with her finger tips,
              examining it.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (incredulous, to
                                herself)
                        Blood...?
 
              She looks up at the ceiling...
 
              DEBBIE'S POV
 
              Wrapped around the rafters is Andy's mangled, bloodied corpse.

              Before Debbie can SCREAM...
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              From beneath the hammock, hidden by the covers, Jason's hand
              reaches up and around and snaps her head back down, pinning
              her to the pillow.
 
              The carving knife is driven through the back of her neck and
              pops out the front, right at CAMERA.  Blood spurts all over
              Debbie's horrified face.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
 
              A flashlight beam sprays directly into the CAMERA LENS
              bleaching out the FRAME.
 
              Derek and Chris silently walk along the dirt road leading
              back to the house.  Derek holds the flashlight.
 
              Their footsteps add to the cacophony of night sounds.  Chris'
              eyes dart about; she's becoming quite uneasy.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Could we move a little faster?
 
                                  DEREK
                        Sure, just watch where you're
                        going.
 
              They start to job.  The beam from their flashlight bounces
              all over the road as they run.
 
              Suddenly and unwittingly, Derek strides into a pothole, twist
              his ankle and falls forward.  The flashlight falls from his
              hand.  Derek lands in the arms of a dark figure standing on
              the side of the road.  Derek gasps as the man clutches him.
 
              Chris grabs the flashlight from the ground and shines the
              light into the man's face...
 
              It's Abel, the aged hitchhiker.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        What're you doing out here?
 
              Derek gets back on his feet.  The ankle is tender.
 
                                  DEREK
                        You know him?

                                  CHRIS
                        Sort of.
 
                                  ABEL
                        I'm one of the Flock as are you my
                        Brother and Sister.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (looking askance)
                        Yeah... sure...
                               (to Chris)
                        I think we should be going.
 
              They start to leave, but Abel blocks their path.
 
                                  ABEL
                        I can't let you go.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Look old man, we don't want any
                        trouble.
 
                                  ABEL
                        Then turn around and walk away
                        from trouble.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Come on, Chris...
 
              Derek hobbles past Abel.  Chris follows a moment later.  Abel
              looks after them as they go then up at the sky.
 
                                  ABEL
                        I have done by best.  I can do no
                        more.
 
              Chris looks back at Abel as she and Derek continue down the
              road.

              INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
 
              Chuck stands at the stove, shaking a pot of popcorn over a
              lit burner.  The corn kernels are actively popping as Chuck
              lifts the cover off the pot, revealing the white fluffy
              morsels as they fly up and out (at CAMERA).  Chuck leans in
              to catch them with his mouth.  He captures a few though more
              land on the floor.  He quickly replaces the lid.
 
              Chili comes in from outside with a flashlight in hand.

                                  CHILI
                        I can't find the bong anywhere.
                        Can't you remember where you
                        dropped it?
 
                                  CHUCK
                        I can't even remember what day it
                        is, man.
 
                                  CHILI
                        It's Friday the 13th.
 
              All the lights go out -- complete darkness except for the
              blue fire of the lit burner.  Chili SCREAMS over the sound of
              the popping corn.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (alarmed)
                        What's the matter?!
 
                                  CHILI
                        Nothin'.  I was just foolin'
                        around.
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Don't do that to me!
 
              Chili flicks on the flashlight and hands it to Chuck.
 
                                  CHILI
                        Here.  Go down the cellar and
                        check the fusebox.
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Will you come with me?
 
                                  CHILI
                        Be a man, man.
 
              Chili takes a kerosene lamp down from the window sill as
              Chuck reluctantly opens the cellar door and starts down the
              stairs.
 
              Chili ignites the lamp's wick, illuminating the kitchen with
              a yellow glow.
 
              She carries the lamp over to the stove and sets it down.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
 
              Barefoot, Chuck tiptoes down into the dark, musty basement.
              The flashlight beam preceeds his every step as he slowly
              advances.
 
              To calm his anxieties, he talks to himself, outloud.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (his eyes roving all
                                around)
                        There's nothin' to be scared of,
                        man.  Just go over to the fusebox
                        and check it out.  You can do
                        that.  Yeah, sure.
 
              His bare feet SLOSH in the line of the water puddles on the
              cellar floor as he nears the fusebox.  He raises the
              flashlight at the open box -- the fuses and electrical wiring
              exposed.  The main switch is in the "OFF" position.
 
              Chuck lifts the switch into the "ON" position.  The naked
              basement bulb glimmers.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (turning to go)
                        Whew... that's better.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Backlit and silhouetted by the bulb is Jason -- a threatening
              sight.
 
              Chuck is startled and scared.  Before he can speak, Jason
              grabs his face with both hands, lifts him off the ground and
              throws him into the open fusebox.
 
              Chuck's feet land in a pool of water as his hands make
              contact with the exposed electrical wires.  Electricity zaps
              through his entire body, electrocuting him.  The lights blink
              on and off.

              INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
 
              Chili is standing at the stove shaking a second pot of
              popcorn kernels.  The blinking lights are an annoyance,
              causing her to squint.  Then, the blinking stops and the
              lights go completely dead.  The lantern remains the only
              light source.

                                  CHILI
                               (calling out)
                        What's goin' on, Chuck?!
 
              There's no answer.  Then abruptly, something heavy bashes
              against the kitchen door.
 
                                  CHILI
                               (continuing)
                        What's goin' on around here?
                        Who's there?
 
              She picks up the lantern and goes to the door.  She hesitates
              then pulls it open.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Shelly's corpse -- his skull split open, his face and chest
              bloodied -- falls into the kitchen at Chili's feet.
 
                                  CHILI
                               (nonchalant)
                        Get up, Shelly.  Stop foolin'
                        around.
 
              She believes this to be another of Shelly's ruses.  Stepping
              over his body, she goes to the basement stairs and calls down
              to Chuck.
 
                                  CHILI
                               (continuing)
                        What're you doin' down there, man?
 
              INT. BASEMENT
 
              Holding the kerosene lamp in front of her, Chili starts down
              the stairs.  FOREBODING MUSIC drones on the SOUNDTRACK,
              accompanying her.
 
                                  CHILI
                        Chuck?
 
              No answer.  She stops at the bottom of the stairs and pans
              the lamp from side to side.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Suddenly, as though suspended from the ceiling, Chuck's head
              and shoulders flop down in front of her, his arms outstretched
              and his face stark white.

                                  CHILI
                               (trembling)

                               (shouting)
                        Help!!!
 
              She turns and runs up the stairs, the kerosene lamp shaking
              wildly in her hand.
 
              INT. KITCHEN
 
              She bolts out of the basement and stumbles over Shelly's
              body, falling to the floor.  She looks back at Shelly and
              realizes that this is not a joke and that he is, indeed, dead.
 
              She gags and, SCREAMING, grabs the still lit kerosene lamp
              and scrambles to her feet.  She runs into the living room.

              Of course, no answer.
 
              FIREPLACE
 
              Unseen by Chili, Jason's hand reaches for a sizzling poker
              left in the fire and pulls out the red-hot iron.
 
              Chili swings open the front door.  The CAMERA MOVES in on her
              from behind.  Crying, she SCREAMS out into the darkness.

                        Vera!  Chris!  Where is

                        Oh please, is anybody here?!

              She looks all around.  It's deathly quiet.  She whips around
              and runs back into the --
 
              LIVING ROOM
 
              right at Jason and into the scorching poker.  It burns
              through her blouse and fries the skin around where it
              penetrates.
