				A Nightmare on Elm Street 3:  
				      Dream Warriors

				     A Screenplay By:
				Wes Craven and Bruce Wagner

	FADE IN:

	A COMPLETELY BLACK SCREEN.  THE FOLLOWING QUOTE IS SUPERED:

				"Sleep.  Those little slices 
				of death.  How I loathe them."

					   -- Edgar Allan Poe

										    FADE TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Warren Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" BLARES from a radio as 
	we begin a CLOSUP MONTAGE:

	CLOSEUP - A YOUNG GIRL'S HAND

	dips a strip of newspaper into a bowl of paper mache mix.

	CLOSEUP - THE WETTED PAPER

	is applied to a paper mache surface, and a popsicle stick is 
	pressed into place.  (We are TOO TIGHT to see the object being 
	constructed.)

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN PARKER

	Kristen (16) is strikingly pretty, despite the dark, tired circles 
	under her eyes.  She's exhausted, but desperately trying to stay 
	awake.  She wears pajamas and robe.

	Her head nods, her eyelids close.  She snaps herself awake.

	CLOSEUP - THE RADIO

	She turns the VOLUME UP EVEN LOUDER.

	CLOSEUP - THE CLOCK

	It's 1:20 a.m.

	CLOSEUP - A JAR OF FOLGER'S COFFEE CRYSTALS

	She scoops out a spoonful.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	She puts the spoonful of coffee crystals in her mouth and chases 
	it down with a swig of Diet Coke.

	CLOSEUP - PAPER MACHE

	Another piece is applied.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	Nodding off again.  She rouses herself angrily.

	WIDER ANGLE

	The bedroom door opens and her mother enters.  ELAINE PARKER, late 
	30's, is dressed in an expensive evening gown that carefully 
	displays her assets.  She snaps the radio off.

						ELAINE
			Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole
			neighborhood!

						KRISTEN
					(bleary-eyed)
			Hi Mom.

						ELAINE
			Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still
			doing up?  It's past one!

						KRISTEN
			I thought I'd wait for you.

						ELAINE
					(softening)
			Well, I'm home now, so you can go right
			to sleep.  C'mon, angel.

						KRISTEN
			It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.

						ELAINE
					(turning down the bed)
			Kristen, don't start with me.  You know
			what your shrink said...

						KRISTEN
					(sullen)
			He's full of shit.

						ELAINE
			I am not going to let you get me into an
			argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now
			get in bed.

	Kristen does as she's told.  Her mother goes to the door and 
	reaches for the light switch.

						KRISTEN
					(a soft plea)
			Mom?  I'm still having these awful dreams.

	A MAN'S VOICE comes from downstairs:

						MAN (O.S.)
			Elaine?  Where do you keep the bourbon?

						ELAINE
			I'll be right down!
					(to Kristen)
			Look honey, I've got a guest.

						KRISTEN
			And you don't want to keep him waiting.

						ELAINE
			That's right.  I don't.

	The door closes, shutting Kristen into darkness.  She lies in bed, 
	blinking back angry tears.  She turns on her side, her gaze 
	falling on:

	THE PAPER MACHE OBJECT

	It is a miniature house glowing weirdly in th moonlight.  A crude, 
	homemade replica of the Elm Street House.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	Staring at the tiny house, hearing her mother's FAINT LAUGHTER 
	downstairs.

	Kristen begins to nod off, though she's fighting it.

	A breeze starts up, rustling her hair.  Leaves fall across her 
	pillow and face.  Her mother's LAUGHTER FADES OUT, replaced by teh 
	EERIE GIGGLING of small children.  She awakes with a start.

	CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, CRANING UP TO REVEAL:

	Kristen's bed sits in the middle of the dark, deserted street in 
	front of the Elm Street House.

	Small CHILDREN are playing on the lawn.  The boys are dressed in 
	suits, the girls in party dresses.  They are jumping rope and 
	chanting a singsong:

						CHILDREN
			One, two, Freddy's coming for you, 
			three, four, better lock your door,
			five, six, grab your crucifix...

	KRISTEN

	gets out of bed and approaches the children, transfixed.

	...except for one eerily pretty LITTLE GIRL sitting on her red 
	tricycle near the front door, hair billowing in the breezes as she 
	stares at Kristen.

						LITTLE GIRL
			Hello.  What's your name?

						KRISTEN
			Kristen.  What's yours?

	The Little Girl giggles and smiles shyly, but doesn't answer.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			What is this place?

	The wind kicks up, MOANING.  We hear the SOUND OF WIND CHIMES.

	THE WIND CHIME

	Tinkling in the wind.  The "chimes" are long razors.

	KRISTEN

	reacts.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The front door of the house CREAKS open behind the Little Girl.  
	Darkness within.

						LITTLE GIRL
					(sadly)
			I have to go now.  Bye.

	RINGING the bell on the handlebar, she pedals her tricycle through 
	the door and is swallowed by the darkness inside.

						KRISTEN
			Wait!  Don't go in there!

	Too late.  Kristen stands alone.  Fighting her fear, she 
	approaches the house.

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kristen enters.  The place is barren, empty.  Broken windows, 
	flaking paint, rotted walls.  Leaves skitter across teh floor.

						KRISTEN
			Little girl!

	THE CHILDREN

	They sense her presence and turn their vacant, staring eyes toward 
	her.  They scatter, vanishing into the shadows...

	She hears the JINGLING of the tricycle bell and the GIGGLING of 
	the Little Girl ECHOING FAINTLY from deep inside the house.  Then 
	silence again.  Kristen tries to follow the sounds.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kristen comes around a corner just in time to see:

	HER POV

	A quick glimpse of the Little Girl vanishing around the corner at 
	the far end of a long, twisted corridor.  The walls are streaked 
	with rust...or perhaps dried blood.

	KRISTEN

	She keeps following.  Being led.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kristen comes around a corner and finds herself facing a heavy 
	steel door that is just closing wiht a SOLID METALLIC CLANG.  The 
	riveted metal seems out of place in the rotted wood house.

	Kristen goes to the door and pulls it slowly open.  A stairway 
	leading down into darkness.

	STAIRWAY

	Kristen carefully makes her way down the metal steps.

	INT. BOILER ROOM

	Kristen fearfully enters Freddy's decrepit lair.  Ancient rusted 
	boilers stand cold and silent in the shadows.

	The SOFT JINGLE of the tricycle draws Kristen's attention.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The Little Girl pedals out of the darkness and comes to a stop 
	before Kristen.

						LITTLE GIRL
			This is where he takes us.

	There is a SCREECH OF METAL.  Kristen whirls and sees:

	A BOILER

	The rusted furnace door is swinging open, metal grating on metal.  
	Inside, the charred bones of children lie in heaps of cold ash.  A 
	tricycle lies in the carnage, identical to the Little Girl's -- 
	only charred.

	KRISTEN

	Horrified.  Suddenly, a METAL DOOR SLAMS LOUDLY in the darkness.  
	THUDDING FOOTSTEPS approach, BOOMING CLOSER.

	THE LITTLE GIRL

	looks up at Kristen with sad eyes.

						LITTLE GIRL
					(eerily calm)
			Freddy's home.

	THE BOILER FURNACE

	Now alive with ROARING FLAMES.  The tricycle's paint bubbles and 
	scorches in the intense heat.

	KRISTEN

	scoops the Little Girl into her arms and runs in blind terror.  
	She glances back over her shoulder to see:

	FREDDY

	looming from the row of boilers, an indistinct silhouette in the 
	hellish smoke and flames.  His maniacal LAUGHTER ECHOES through 
	the chamber.

	KRISTEN

	ducks through a doorway into another room, still carrying the 
	Little Girl.

	INT. ROOM

	A hundred teenage bodies hang from teh ceiling, strung up in the 
	darkness like butchered meat.

	KRISTEN

	gazes in horror.  She looks down at the Little Girl cradled in her 
	arms -- she is now a horribly charred, brittle corpse.  Suddenly, 
	her tiny mouth bursts open, emitting a ghastly, ear-splitting 
	SCREAM!

									     SHOCK CUT TO:

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	As she sits bolt upright in bed, panting in terror, face bathed in 
	sweat.  She looks around, recognizing her own room.

	She gets out of bed and walks unsteadily to the bathroom.

	INT - BATHROOM

	She clicks on the light and looks at her reflection in the mirror.  
	Still trembling, she runs water in the sink and splashes her face, 
	trying to calm down.

	The water becomes too hot.  Steam rises.

	She tries to turn the water off, but the pressure increases.  More 
	Steam.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	She fiddles with the handle, confused.

	As she turns it, the four-pronged handle suddenly springs to life, 
	grasping her hand.

	KRISTEN

	gasps and looks up.  Freddy's face grins out at her from the 
	mirror.  She SCREAMS.  Steam billows up.

	THE SINK

	The other faucet handle begins to flex and stretch, turning into 
	Freddy's claw hand.  Finger razors grow.

	KRISTEN

	SCREAMING, struggling to break free.

	FREDDY

	leering from the mirror, laughing.  The claw hand rises up into 
	frame, poising to slash Kristen's exposed wrist.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	SCREAMING as the blades slash downward.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

	Grinning as a spray of blood hits the mirror.

	THE BATHROOM DOOR

	bursts open, revealing Kristen's mother.  She SCREAMS.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE BATHROOM

	No steam.  The mirror and sink are normal...except for the thin 
	streaks of spattered blood.

	Kristen turns to her mother, slowly waking from her dream.  She 
	holds a bloody razor in her hand.  Her wrist is slashed.

						KRISTEN
					(dazed, weak)
			Mommy...?

	She collapses.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. WESTIN HILLS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

	Isolated and somewhat gothic, it's an enormous multi-winged 
	structure built by the Catholic Church in the 1920's.  A belltower 
	is centerpiece to several rambling wings.  Originally an insane 
	asylum, it is now a modernized state-run facility.  An iron fence 
	surrounds the sprawling grounds.

	INT. HOSPITAL - ADOLESCENT WING - DAY

	DOLLYING with MAX, the burly black Chief Orderly, as he makes his 
	morning rounds.  He wheels a rolling cart containing a variety of 
	medications down the hall.  A NEWSCASTER'S VOICE comes from the 
	small portable radio dangling from the cart:

						NEWSCASTER
			In local nows, two more teenage deaths
			have occurred -- both suicides.  County
			health officials are at a loss to explain
			this alarming trend --

	Grimacing, Max switches to a music station as DOCTOR NEIL GOLDMAN 
	(early 30's), bright and intense, falls in step.

						NEIL
					(absorbed in a clipboard
					 of patient's charts)
			Nothing like a little cheery news to start 
			the day.

						MAX
			Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about
			all these suicides.

						NEIL
			Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all
			the help we can get.

						MAX
			Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about
			it.  Their parents all dropped acid in 
			the Sixties.

						NEIL
			It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks
			it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock
			& roll.

						MAX
			Shit, that's what keeps people alive.

	Max exits frame.  Neil continues on.  JENNIFER,  a girl of 14, 
	approaches.

						NEIL
			Good morning, Jennifer.

						JENNIFER
			Morning, Doctor Goldman.

						NEIL
			How's your hand?

	She extends her hand for inspection -- it is scarred with 
	cigarette burns.  She points to three different welts.

						JENNIFER
			Menthol, regular, ultra-light.

						NEIL
			They're healing up nicely.

						JENNIFER
			I've been good.  When do I get cigarette
			priveleges back?

						NEIL
			Don't hold your breath.

	Jennifer shrugs.  It was worth a try.  She moves on.

	TARYN, a 17 year old blonde, approaches.  She appears exhausted, 
	dark tired circles under her eyes.

						NEIL
			Hi Taryn.  You don't look so hot, kid.
			Been getting any sleep?

	She ignores him.  Neil watches her float past, then jots a note on 
	his clipboard.

						NEIL (cont.)
			Didn't think so.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Neil comes to the Quiet Room and peers through the small mesh-grid 
	window.

	NEIL'S POV - (QUIET ROOM)

	KINCAID, an enormous and powerful-looking 17 year old with a 
	shaved head is huddled in the corner of the white padded room, 
	gazing at nothing.

	NEIL - (HALLWAY)

	makes a notation on his clipboard.  DOCTOR ELIZABETH SIMMS, the 
	hospital superior, appears at his elbow.

						SIMMS
			How is he?

						NEIL
			Cooling down.

						SIMMS
			If he continues having these outbursts,
			I'll have to have him isolated permanently.

						NEIL
			Don't worry, it won't come to that.

	They exit frome.  CAMERA PUSHES UP to teh mesh-grid window of the 
	Quiet Room for a shot of Kincaid.

	CLOSEUP - KINCAID - (QUIET ROOM)

	He stares into space, singing softly under his breath.

						KINCAID
			I ain't gonna dream no more, no more,
			I ain't gonna dream no more.  All night
			long I sing this song, 'cause I ain't 
			gonna dream no more...

	DOLLYING WITH NEIL AND SIMMS - (HALLWAY)

						NEIL
			I read the report on our new staff 
			member.

						SIMMS
			What did you think?

						NEIL
			Frankly, I don't understand why some
			grad school superstar is being treated
			like a seasoned pro.

						SIMMS
			She's been doing ground-breaking
			research on pattern nightmares.

						NEIL
			Elizabeth, we don't need any outside
			help.  I know these kids.  I don't 
			want some hot-shot taking chances 
			with them just so she can get published.

	Simms is about to say more, but is interrupted by:

						P.A. VOICE
			Doctor Goldman to Examination, stat.

	They hurry down the hall.

	NURSES' STATION

	Kristen's mother, near hysteria, is loudly berating a NURSE.

						ELAINE
			Don't give me that shit!  She's just 
			trying to get attention, that's all!
			I'm not playing her little game any-
			more!

	Neil and Simms rush past into the examination room.

	INT. EXAMINATION ROOM

	Neil and Simms burst into a chaotic struggle.  Kristen is going 
	berserk, fighting the STAFF as they try to restrain her and 
	wrestle her onto a gurney -- the gurney goes crashing into the 
	wall.  A frantic NURSE addresses Neil:

						NURSE
			Suicide attempt.  They just brought her
			in from County General!

						NEIL
			What's her name?

						NURSE
			Kristen Parker.  She was fine until we
			tried to sedate her.

	Her face contorted with terror, Kristen kicks and bites and 
	scratches as ORDERLIES try to pin her.

						ORDERLY
			Watch it!  She tore her stiches out!

						NEIL
			Kristen, we want to help you!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Max enters and takes immediate control.  he shoves everybody out 
	of the way, spins Kristen effortlessly around, and pins her arms 
	firmly from behind.  She tries to struggle, but he's too strong.  
	She weakens.

						MAX
					(compassionate)
			Calm down, baby sister, that's enough
			nonsense for now.

	Neil takes a hypo from the nurse and approaches Kristen slowly.

						NEIL
			Kristen, I'm Doctor Goldman.  I'm not
			going to hurt you.  I'm just going to
			give you something to help you sleep.

	KRISTEN goes berserk again and kicks Neil in the stomach.  Max is 
	thrown off balance and crashes into a rolling cart -- medical 
	instruments shower to the floor.

	Kristen grabs a pair of wicked-looking surgical scissors.  She 
	slashes at max's hand, drawing blood.

						NEIL
			Back off, Max!

	Kristen huddles into a corner, ready to skewer anybody who gets 
	close.  A tense stand-off.

						NEIL (cont.)
			Kristen, put the scissors down!  No-
			body's gonna hurt you!

	But the girl makes no move to drop her guard.  She starts rocking 
	back and forth, coming apart at the seams, moaning a little song:

						KRISTEN
			Five, six, grab your crucifix...
			seven, eight, better stay up late...
			nine, ten, never...never...

	She can't seem to find the words in her confused mind.

						NANCY (O.S.)
			Never sleep again.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Instant silence in the room.  All eyes go to NANCY THOMPSON 
	standing in the doorway.  She's a young woman now, possessing 
	beauty and great inner strength.  her hair still bears the white 
	streak.  She speaks as if coming out of a trance:

						NANCY
			Who taught you that rhyme?

	KRISTEN

	Her eyes are locked with Nancy's.

	NANCY

	The staff members part before her as she walks to Kristen.  She 
	takes the scissors from Kristen's hand.  Kristen falls into 
	Nancy's arms, sobbing.

	NEIL

	stares at Nancy in amazement.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY

	Neil and Nancy are finishing a late lunch in teh nearly deserted 
	cafeteria.

						NANCY
			Tell me about the kids.

						NEIL
			You'll get to meet them all tomorrow.
			They're...survivors.  In a way.  All
			severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia,
			narcolepsy, bedwetting...

						NANCY
			But nightmares are the common thread?

						NEIL
			Right.  They seem to share a group
			delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of
			a better word.  They're so traumatized,
			they'll do anything not to sleep.

						NANCY
			Anything?

						NEIL
					(playing with his coffee)
			We lost a kid about a month ago to
			Fairview.  I don't know where he got
			the razor...but he cut off his own
			eyelids to stay awake.

						NANCY
			Oh God.

						NEIL
			Ever work with vets?
					(Nancy shakes her head)
			These kids act like they've got
			D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome.
			If I didn't know better, I'd swear 
			they'd seen heavy combat.

						NANCY
			I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.

						NEIL
			What's that supposed to mean?

	She shrugs, not answering.  Neil lets it pass.

						NEIL (cont.)
					(changing the subject)
			By the way, that was great work with
			the new patient.  Pretty smooth for an
			intern.

						NANCY
			I've had some experience with pattern
			nightmares.

						NEIL
			So I've been told.  Practically an 
			obsession of your.

						NANCY
			Call it a passion.
					(glances at her watch)
			I've got to get going.

						NEIL
			Make sure to check in with Max, he'll
			give you the 25 cent tour.

	She gathers her things.  Her purse falls over, scattering its 
	contents.  A bottle of pills rolls out.  Neil helps gather the 
	items -- he picks up the pills.

	INSERT - PILL BOTTLE

	The label reads: HYPNOCYL 60 mg.  1-2 TABS FOR SLEEP.

	BACK TO SCENE

	She takes the pills and stuffs them in her purse along with 
	everything else.

						NANCY
			Thanks.  See you in the morning.

	She is almost out the door when Neil calls to her.

						NEIL
			Ms. Thompson.

						NANCY
			Call me Nancy.

						NEIL
			Only if you call me Neil.  What was that
			nursery rhyme all about?

						NANCY
			Just something children sing...to keep
			the boogeyman away.

	She exits.  Neil stares after her thoughtfully.

	HIS POV - LONG LENS OF THE CROWDED HALLWAY

	As Nancy turns and vanishes from sight, a NUN is a white habbit is 
	revealed at the far end of the hallway -- she seems to be staring 
	at him.  PEOPLE are wiping frame as they criss-cross the hallway, 
	affording mere glimpses of her.

	NEIL

	A bit slf-conscious.  Is the woman really staring at him?

	HIS POV - LONG LENS

	People keep wiping frame as they bustle in the hallway.  The nun 
	is now gone.

	NEIL

	frowns, puzzled.  he dismisses it and downs his last sip of 
	coffee.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

	Max is giving Nancy a tour.

						MAX
			The whole wing's devoted ot this 
			program.  That's your office.

						NANCY
			A little basic, but nice.

						MAX
			I'll have a file cabinet in there before
			tomorrow.
					(leading her down a hall)
			The patient's rooms are down here.

	Nancy pauses at an open door, looking into:

	INT. PHILLIP'S ROOM

	PHILLIP, 16, sits at a work table fashioning the face of a 
	homemade marionette out of clay.  Other marionettes hang from the 
	wall. A comical dog, a white knight, a clown, etc.

						MAX
					(from doorway)
			This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.

						NANCY
			Why is that?

						PHILLIP
			'Cause I sleepwalk.  A perfectly normal
			event that our illustrious staff loves
			to theorize about endlessly.

						MAX
			Phillip, this is Nancy.

						PHILLIP
			Hi.  Welcome to the Snake Pit.

						NANCY
			Thanks.
					(admiring marionettes)
			Nice work.

						PHILLIP
			They really oughtta be carved out of 
			wood, but they won't let me have a
			knife.  I might, you know...
					(mimes slashing his wrist)
			Fffft!

						MAX
			That lump over there is Kincaid.

	Kincaid is lying on a bed, reading a comic book.

						MAX (cont.)
			Take a close look.  He gets his ass
			thrown in the Quiet Room so often, 
			you probably won't see much of him.
			Right, Cool Breeze?

						KINCAID
			I do it so I don't have to look at your
			face all the time.

						MAX
					(grins)
			Riiiigghht.

	Max and Nancy move on.

	INT. HALLWAY

	DOLLYING WITH Max and Nancy.

						MAX
			They're good kids.  But don't let 'em
			fool you.  They're dangerous...to 
			themselves and each other.

	They exit frame.  PAN TO JOEY, a wan 16 year old watching them 
	from around the corner.  He has a tear drop drawn in ink under one 
	eye.

	A SOFT RYTHMIC SQUEAKING draws his attention.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	MARCIE, a cute 19 year old candy-striper, is wheeling a cart to a 
	laundry closet.

	As she begins to load the cart with clean towels, several fall to 
	the floor.  Joey hurries over.

	CLOSER ANGLE

	Joey picks up the towels and holds them out to Marcie.  She gives 
	him a bright smile.

						MARCIE
			Why thank you, Joey.

	Joey grins mutely, obviously smitten.  LORENZO, a cocky, handsome 
	young orderly appears.

						LORENZO
			Hey, Marcie.  These going to C Ward?

						MARCIE
			Yeah.

						LORENZO
			C'mon, I'll walk you down.

	They start down the hall, the cart still SQUEAKING RYTHMICALLY.  
	Marcie turns back, giving Joey a smile and a wave.

						MARCIE
			See you later.

	JOEY

	smiles weakly as he watches them go.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. KRISTEN'S HOUSE - DAY

	Nancy guides Kristen's mother through signing a sheaf of hospital 
	forms.  Elaine is carefully and expensively dressed in fashionable 
	tennis clothes.

						NANCY
			Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different?
			Did you notice anything strange before 
			she made the attempt?

						ELAINE
			Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've
			spent thousands on psychiatirists.

						NANCY
			Did she always have nightmares?

						ELAINE
			They've gotten worse since I took away
			her credit cards.

						NANCY
			I'm serious.

						ELAINE
			Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what
			you want from me.

						NANCY
			Just some answers.  There are other kids
			involved, its not just Kristen.  All 
			good kids, smark kids.

						ELAINE
			I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the
			experts on this, not me.  If I had any
			insights, believe me, I'd share them
			with you.

						NANCY
			I'm sure you would.

						ELAINE
					(rising)
			Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get
			to the club.

						NANCY
			I'll need to take her things.

						ELAINE
			The maid packed a suitcase.
					(calling out)
			Teresa!  Teresa?

						NANCY
			I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.

						ELAINE
			First door up the stairs.

	INT. KRISTEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Nancy enters and finds the suitcase on the bed.  As she turns to 
	leave, her eye is caught by:

	THE PAPER MACHE ELM STREET HOUSE

	sitting on Kristen's drafting table.

	NANCY

	Amazed.  Shaken.  She reaches out slowly, almost afraid to touch 
	it.  She picks it up.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Neil sits at a computer terminal in his study.  He hooks the modem 
	to his phone and accesses a mainframe.  The screen comes to life, 
	blinking.  He punches in a command.

	THE SCREEN

	A readout appears, ticking down an endless list of drug 
	categories.

	NEIL

	Working the keyboard, searching for something.  Finally:

	THE SCREEN

	The glowing green letters read:

			HYPNOCYL
			FDA classification:  Experimental.
			Effective for management of
			psychotic disorders.  For sedation
			where dreamless sleep is considered
			optimal; suppression of night terror.

	NEIL

	He shuts down the computer and eases back in his chair.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NANCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Nancy sits in a thin, high-tech reading chair, engrossed in 
	Kristen's medical file.  The paper mache Elm Street House sits on 
	a table nearby.

	CLOSEUP - NANCY

	Shee is starting to nod off as she reads.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - KRISTEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Kristen lies in bed, sketching on a newsprint pad with charcoal.  
	A rendering of the Elm Street House.

	She begins to nod out.  her eyes flutter closed.  CAMERA DOLLIES 
	IN TIGHT on her face.  We hear the DISTANT, GHOSTLY JINGLING of a 
	tricycle bell.  Her eyes slowly open.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kristen watches, terrified, as a tricycle rolls into the room by 
	itself, leaving bloody tire tracks.  The same tricycle that 
	belonged to the Little Girl.

	THE TRICYCLE

	comes to a stop...then begins to glow red-hot and melt, warping 
	and sagging as if from an astonishing inner heat.

	KRISTEN

	gets out of bed, edges past the ghastly melting apparition, and 
	backs out of the room.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	As she backs out the door, we see it is the red Elm Street door.  
	She pauses, realizing something is terribly wrong -- suddenly the 
	door SLAMS SHUT INTO CAMERA.

	CAMERA ZOOMS OUT IN A DIZZYING RUSH to reveal the Elm Street 
	House.  Kristen is now trapped inside.

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE

	Kristen tries to get out, but the door is locked.  She turns, 
	looking for another means of escape.  We hear a FAINT BUZZING.

	INT. DINING ROOM

	Kristen enters.  The BUZZING IS LOUDER.

	HER POV - THE DINNER TABLE

	The table is set for a formal dinner.  The grotesque, rotted 
	remains of a roast pig sits on a platter, covered with flies.

	KRISTEN

	is revolted.

	THE PIG

	leaps up, SQUEALING.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Kristen is suddenly pulled down, vanishing beneath the surface of 
	the liquid floor.  The furnishings remain, hanging in their own 
	gravity.

	UNDERWATER

	Kristen thrashes wildly in the the pitch-black water.  She swims 
	frantically, lungs bursting for air.  Impossible to tell which way 
	is up.

	HER POV

	A door hanging in watery limbo a short distance ahead.

	KRISTEN

	swims for it.

	THE DOOR

	She clutches the ornate handle and strains to open the door.

	INT. ROOM (OTHER SIDE OF TEH DOOR)

	The door swings open.  Kristen emerges from a solid wall of water 
	and steps into the room.  She is magically dry.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	It is the Elm Street living room, foreboding and nearly barren of 
	furniture.

	A large lump forms under the rug at the far end of the room and 
	undulates toward her sinuously.  A long tubular shape.

	Kristen backs away.

	The shape circles her aimlessly, then slithers up the wall -- a 
	huge, writhing entity traveling within the wall surface.

	The shape arcs back down toward the carpet and disappears below 
	the floorline.

	Kristen turns about apprehensively, searching for the mysterious 
	entity.  Beat.

	Suddenly, the creatures erupts through the floor directly beneath 
	her in a shower of wood splinters, engulfing her legs as it 
	rockets straight up.  It slams back down like a whale surfacing, 
	Kristen locked firmly in its jaws.

	THE CREATURE

	is a gigantic serpent/worm version of Freddy, ribbed and organic, 
	encrusted with mucous and slime.  Its slavering jaws dislocate 
	like a snake's, the skin stretching grotesquely as it begins to 
	swallow Kristen from the legs up.

			NANCY!

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NANCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	E.C.U. Nancy dozing.  Her eyes flutter open as she hears a FAINT 
	REVERBERATION of Kristen's call.

	LOW ANGLE

	Nancy strains to listen -- all is silent now.  uneasy, she rises 
	from her chair...but freezes in place as she hears the UNEARTHLY 
	CALL again, brely discernable.  She turns.

	THE ELM STREET HOUSE MODEL

	The sound seems to emanate from the strange paper mache dollhouse.  
	CAMERA RUSHES IN TIGHT as its tiny front door swings slowly open.

	NANCY

	DOLLYING IN TIGHT ON HER FACE as she puts a hand to her head, a 
	feeling of dizziness suddenly washing over her.

	WIDER

	She sinks back into her chair -- and keeps right on going, 
	impossibly sucked away into the thin chair.  She is gone in the 
	blink of an eye.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	A large ornate oval mirror hangs on the wall.  The glass EXPLODES 
	as Nancy bursts into the room.

	She rises, staring in horror and disbelief.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	The horrid Freddy/snake expands and contracts around Kristen, 
	slowly wolfing her down, its awful diseased maw inching up past 
	her waist.

						KRISTEN
			NANCY!

	NANCY

	snaps into action.  She scoops up a long jagged shard of broken 
	mirror, cutting her palm in the process.

	She leaps into the fray, jamming the shard of glass into 
	Freddy/snake's eye -- the eye bursts, spraying rancid ichor.

	FREDDY/SNAKE

	Regurgitating Kristen, the creature arcs back, ready to strike.  
	his good eye locks on Nancy, recognizing his old enemy.

						FREDDY/SNAKE
					(total rage)
			YOU!

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY/SNAKE

	ROARS as the snake face peels back like old parchment and 
	instantly transforms into a mind blowing skull/snake/Freddy with 
	horns and double rows of razor teeth -- striking INTO CAMERA.

	NANCY

	grabs Kristen and barrel-rolls out of the way.  They scramble out 
	the door.

	INT. HALLWAY (OTHER SIDE OF DOOR)

	Nancy slams the door and fumbles with the lock, snapping it into 
	place.

						NANCY
			You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?

						KRISTEN
			I -- I think so!

	The razor-teeth burst through the door, splintering it.

						NANCY
			Then get us back out!

	Kristen tries to concentrate -- the teeth tear a chunk from the 
	door and the Freddy/beast's drooling snout lunges through.  
	Chewing.  Tearing.

						NANCY (cont.)
			NOW, KRISTEN!  DO IT NOW!

						KRISTEN
					(muttering, pleading)
			Wake up , wake up, wake up --

	The door EXPLODES in on them as we 

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NANCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	nancy thrashes awake in her reading chair, knocking a cup of 
	coffee across them room.  She is shaking in the aftermath of 
	terror, her fists clenched tight, not knowing if she just dreamed 
	it all or not.

	Suddenly realizing, she unclenches her hand -- the palm is cut 
	from the shard of broken mirror she plunged into Freddy/snake's 
	eye.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

	Nancy bursts in with the Elm Street House model under her arm and 
	hurries down the hallway -- right past Neil.

						NEIL
			You're late.

						NANCY
			Didn't get much sleep.

						NEIL
			Well, we've got --

	But she's already turned the corner and gone.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Nancy rushes up to Kristen's room and looks in.  Empty.  Max 
	appears, coming up the hall.

						NANCY
			Max, where's Kristen?

						MAX
			She's been waiting outside your office
			since breakfast.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - (NANCY'S OFFICE HALL)

	Nancy rushes around the corner and stops.  Kristen is sitting 
	patiently in the hallway outside Nancy's office.  She stands.

						NANCY
					(holds up Elm Street model)
			I used to live in this house.

						KRISTEN
			But...it's just a house I've dreamed 
			about.
					(lower)
			I dream about it all the time.
					(pause)
			Thank you for what you did last night.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NANCY'S OFFICE - DAY

	Nancy and Kristen speak in low tones with the door closed.

						NANCY
			Have you ever done that before?  Pulled
			someone into your dream?

						KRISTEN
					(dreamy, far-away look)
			When I was a little girl.  Three or four.
			If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in.
			The dream would always get better.
					(smiles)
			He always used to tell me about it the 
			next day -- he used to think they were
			his dreams.
						NANCY
			When did it stop?

						KRISTEN
			When I was still a kid.  My folks got
			divorced.
					(beat)
			After a while, I thought I'd imagined
			the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.

						NANCY
			It's an amazing gift.

	Pause.  Then, softly:

						KRISTEN
			That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't
			he?

						NANCY
			He's real.

	INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY

	All the kids of the Adolescent Care Unit are gathered:  Kincaid, 
	Phillip, Taryn, Joey, Jennifer, and WILL, a 17 year old confined 
	to an electric wheelchair.  Kristen's a bit uncomfortable -- she's 
	the new kid.  The general impression is of a blitzed-out squad 
	just out of heavy combat.  Nancy takes of a blitzed-out squad just 
	out of heavy combat.  Nancy takes her place next to Elizabeth 
	Simms as Neil closes the door.

						NEIL
			Okay, Group's in session.  Straight 
			talk only in this room.

						SIMMS
			Today I'd like to start by getting us
			acquainted with our new staff member,
			Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel 
			welcome.

	The kids murmur a chorus of AD-LIBBED GREETINGS.

						NEIL
			Let's see, you've already met Phillip, 
			Kincaid, and Kristen.  Why don't the 
			rest of you tell Nancy something about
			yourselves?

	those click-clack kinetic toys sitting on the table.  No 
	volunteers.

						NEIL (cont.)
			Will?  How about you first?

						WILL
			I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a
			little accident, as you can see.

						TARYN
			Accident my ass.  I thought this was
			supposed to be straight talk in here.

						KINCAID
			Hey, so he took a jump.  At least he
			wasn't sticking needles in his arms
			with a bunch of lowlifes.

						SIMMS
			Save it, Kincaid.  Jennifer?

						JENNIFER
			I'm Jennifer Caulfield.  When I get
			out of here I'm going to L.A. to be 
			an actress.  i'm gonna be on T.V.

						KINCAID
			Yeah.  Lifestyles of the Rich and
			Psychotic.

						JENNIFER
			Screw you.
					(indicates Joey)
			This is Joey.  He used to be a debater
			in school, but now he doesn't talk much.

	Joey grins at Nancy shyly, nodding his head in greeting.

						TARYN
			I'm Taryn White.  I only came here
			because it was a better deal than 
			juvie hall.
					(pause)
			Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through
			some very stange shit.

						NANCY
			Your dreams?

						TARYN
					(softly)
			Hey, everybody has bad dreams.

						PHILLIP
			Can I interject something here?  Just
			to save us all some time?

						NEIL
			Go ahead, Phillip.

						PHILLIP
					(to Nancy)
			According to our kind hosts, our dreams
			are a group psychosis.  Sort of a mellow
			mass hysteria.  The fact that we all 
			dreamt about this guy before we ever
			met doesn't seem to impress anybody.

	The kids murmur in agreement.

						PHILLIP (cont.)
			So we go in circles making minimal
			progress with maximum effort.

						SIMMS
			And you won't make any progress until
			you can recognize your dreams for what
			they are.

						NANCY
			And what are they?

						SIMMS
			The by-product of guilt.  Psychological
			scars steaming from moral conflicts and
			overt sexuality.

						KINCAID
			Great.  Now it's my dick that's killing
			me.

						KRISTEN
			Tell them, Nancy.  Tell them what's 
			really going on.

						NEIL
					(surprised)
			Yes, tell us, Nancy.

						NANCY
			All I can say is this isn't something
			that's just going to disappear.  you're
			all going to have to face it.  Fight it.
			And if you're willing to work together...
			wiling to stand up to your deepest
			fears...I think we can beat it.

	PANNING THE KIDS

	Their expressions reflect a quiet mix of hope and fear.  They are 
	impressed -- all except Kincaid.

			My deepest fear is listening to any more

	with rapt attention.  Taryn throws the dice.

	Phillip and Kincaid lie sleeping in their beds.  DOLLY SLOWLY IN 
	on Phillip.  He moans softly -- perhaps a troubled dream.

	BOOM UP TO the marionettes hanging on the wall.  An eerie 
	collection of moonlit figures.

	DOLLY IN FOR CLOSEUP on the unfinished marionette.  It raises its 
	gray, misshapen head.

	The crude clay features ripple and change into a distinct likeness 
	of Freddy.

	CLOSEUP - MARIONETTE'S HAND

	Sharp razor-claws generate from the stubby clay fingers.

	FREDDY/MARIONETTE

	swipes his claws at his strings, cutting himself loose.

	THE FLOOR

	Freddy/marionette lands in a cat-like crouch.  As he straightens 
	up, he starts to grow.

	PHILLIP

	stirs...his eyes open.

	PHILLIP'S POV

	Freddy/marionette rises into view at teh foot of the bed...growing

	PHILLIP

	opens his mouth to scream.

	flicking downward with a single blade, quickly, precisely.  Again

	CLOSEUP - PHILLIP

	in excruciating pain, unable to move a muscle.

	HIGH ANGLE

	Looking down at Phillip.  Clean, nearly bloodless incisions have

	Neither of them notice Phillip as he sleepwalks past in the

	JOEY'S POV - THE BELL TOWER

	It stands stories above the rest of the massive, rambling 
	hospital, the apex of all teh wings of the building.  TILT UP to

	building from behind as if it were a marionette stage, laughing 
	maniacally as he puppets Phillip.

	Freddy draws back his claw hand -- then slashes out, slicing 
	Phillip's strings.

			That's enough, Kincaid.

	Neil pauses, wavering between nancy and Simms.  He finally comes 
	to a decision:

						NEIL
			Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.
					(she gives him a 
					 blank stare)
			It's a dream suppressant.

						SIMMS
			I know what it is.  I just can't believe
			what I'm hearing.
					(indicates Nancy)
			What has she talked you into?

						NEIL
			Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's 
			my decision.  I want the dreams stopped
			until we get some answers.

						SIMMS
			I won't allow it.

						NEIL
			I'll go straight to Carver if I have
			to.  He'll either back me up or accept
			my resignation.

	Simms pauses, then:

						SIMMS
			If soemthing goes wrong, I'll make sure
			you're held responsible.  Fully responsible.

	Simms exits.  Neil watches her go.

						NEIL
			I can't believe I just did that.

						NANCY
			Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in
			by tomorrow?

						NEIL
			We're gonna try.

	He turns and walks away -- but pauses, looking back.

						NEIL
			I hope you know what you're getting us
			into.

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	DOLLYING with Max as he works his way down the hall, spot-checking 
	the dorm area.  Nancy appears.

						MAX
			Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If
			you're trying for O.T., you're in the 
			wrong place.

						NANCY
			I just wanted to be here for the kids.
			how are they?

						MAX
			Restless.  Very restless.

	Kristen appears at her door, looking sleepy and exhausted.

						KRISTEN
			Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?

						NANCY
			Sure.

						MAX
					(to Nancy)
			You need me, I'll be here all night.

						NANCY
			Thanks, Max.

	She goes to join Kristen in her room.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Taryn, wearing robe and slippers, emerges from the women's 
	bathroom and shuffles back toward her room.

	Lorenzo, the young orderly, appears in her path, twirling a 
	keyring.

						LORENZO
			Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.

						TARYN
					(disinterested, tries
					 to get past him)
			Can't be good news coming from you.

						LORENZO
			Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.

						TARYN
			So?

						LORENZO
					(twirling keys)
			So...got the keys to heaven, baby.

						TARYN
			What?

						LORENZO
			The dispensary.  I'm talking clean
			pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club
			meth.

						TARYN
					(steps past him)
			I don't do that shit.

	He grabs her wrist, exposing her arm -- her skin is scarred with 
	old needle tracks.

						LORENZO
			What are these, beauty marks?

						TARYN
					(yanks her arm away)
			Those are ancient history.

						LORENZO
			Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the
			mood for a history lesson, I'm your 
			teacher, understand?

						TARYN
			Stay out of my face or I'll go straight
			to Max.

						LORENZO
			Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy
			junkie chick like you?

						TARYN
			Fuck off.

	She heads off to her room.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT

	A rather drab, institutional room with second-hand couches an 
	chairs.  jennifer sits in a worn armchair watching the TV -- a 
	massive old metal RCA.  She is fighting sleep, but starting to nod 
	off.  Max enters.

						MAX
			Girl, what are you doing?

						JENNIFER
			Watching TV.

						MAX
			I can see that. You watch too damn much
			TV.

						JENNIFER
			Research.

						MAX
			Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.

						JENNIFER
			Wait and see.

						MAX
			If Simms catches you in here after lights
			out, she'll chew my ass ragged.

						JENNIFER
					(pleading)
			I gotta stay up, Max.

						MAX
			Jennifer --

						JENNIFER
			Just tonight, please?  I can't handle
			the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not
			after Phillip.

	Max hesitates...then relents against his better judgement.

						MAX
			If you get caught, I never saw you.
			Deal?

						JENNIFER
					(relieved)
			Deal.  Thanks.

	Max exits, shaking his head.  Jennifer turns back to the TV -- the 
	Late Show drones on.  She shakes herself, still fighting to stay 
	awake.

	She digs a hidden pack of cigarettes from under the chair cushion 
	and lights up.  She takes a deep drag -- then, wincing with pain, 
	burns her hand with the lit cigarette.  Anything to stay awake.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. KRISTEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Kristen lies in bed.  Nancy sits nearby in a chair -- it seems she 
	may keep an all-night vigil.

	She notices an array of gymnastics posters taped to the wall.

						NANCY
			You like gymnastics?

						KRISTEN
					(nods)
			I was on the team at school.
					(beat)
			I was never very good, though.

						NANCY
			We're not always as good at things as
			we'd like.

						KRISTEN
			Yeah, but I was really not good.

	They laugh softly.

						KRISTEN
			Yeah, but I was really not good.

	They laugh softly.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			I'm glad you're here.

	Nancy pauses, wrestling with a decision.  She digs into her purse, 
	pulls out her bottle of Hypnocyl, and shakes the contents into her 
	hand.  Just two pills left.  She gives them to Kristen.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			What are they?

						NANCY
					(softly)
			They'll keep the dreams away.  For
			tonight.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT

	Jennifer is still fighting to stay awake as she watches TV.  She 
	switches around with the channel changer, stopping on a Dick 
	Cavett interview.  His guest is Sally Kellerman.

	JENNIFER

	nodding out again.

	TV SET

						DICK CAVETT
			Well, that is the great American dream,
			isn't it?  To come to L.A. and be a TV
			star?

						SALLY KELLERMAN
			Well, I suppose it --

	The image sputters with snowy interference.

	JENNIFER

	Her eyes fluttering.

	TV SET

	Alternating between snow and image.

						KELLERMAN
			-- find a good teacher.  An actor has 
			to study, to learn.  I think that's
			crucial.

						FREDDY/CAVETT
					(gleefully)
			WHO GIVES A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK?

	JENNIFER

	Her eyes snap open, her body stiffening.  She stares at:

	TEH TV SCREEN

	Nothing now but static.

	JENNIFER

	Frowning.  Must have imagined it.  She rises and smacks the side 
	of the set, trying to get the picture back.  Nothing.

	Suddenly, two arms rip from each side of the TV set and grab her 
	by the shoulders.  The arms are a horrid hybrid of Freddy's arms 
	and RCA tubes and wiring.  She SCREAMS as she is lifted off the 
	ground.

	TV SET

	Freddy's head grows and stretches out of the top of the set, 
	wearing the rabbit-ear antenna like some horrible insect.  
	Jennifer keeps SCREAMING.

						FREDDY
			This is it, Jennifer!  Your big break
			in TV!

	he rams her head into the screen with hideously brutal force -- 
	there is an EXPLOSION of glass and electrical sparks.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

	A midwestern cemetary on a rolling hillside.  A gentle drizzle 
	falls on a crowd of mourners clustered at twin gravesites.  A 
	PRIEST intones the eulogy.  Among the mourners are Dr. Simms, Max, 
	Nancy...but Neil is missing.

	CLOSER - MAX AND NANCY

	Staring as the caskets are lowered.

	MASTER - THE FUNERAL

	CAMERA BOOMS BACK to reveal Neil standing on a rise overlooking 
	the funeral.  he's under the shelter of a large oak tree, but is 
	still soaked by the drizzle.  He stares down, grief-stricken, his 
	tears masked by rain.

						NUN (O.S.)
			Don't be ashamed, young man.  This is
			a place for sorrow.

	ANTOHER ANGLE

	The nun in white stands clsoe by (Neil saw her in the hospital 
	hallway).  She appears in her 60's, but carries herself with a 
	strength that belies her years.  Neil wipes his eyes.

						NUN (cont.)
			What faith do you follow?

	He chokes back a bitter laugh.

						NEIL
			Science...I suppose.

						NUN
			A sad choice.

						NEIL
			There are times when it doesn't offer
			much comfort.
					(pause)
			I've seen you before.  Sister...?

						NUN
			Mary Helena.

						NEIL
			You do volunteer work at the hospital?

						NUN
			I come from time to time.  When I'm
			needed.

	Neil turns his gaze back toward the funeral, lost in his own 
	private grief.

						NEIL
					(softly)
			I could've saved them.

						NUN
			Only one thing can save the children.
			The unquiet spirit must be laid to 
			rest.  It is an abomination to God and
			Man.

						NEIL
					(blankly)
			I beg your pardon?

						NANCY
					(calling O.S.)
			Neil?

	Neil turns and moves to the edge of the rise as Nancy crests the 
	hill.  The services have ended, the crowd is dispersing.

						NANCY (cont.)
			What are you doing up here?

						NEIL
			I was just talking to --

	He turns, but the nun is gone.

						NANCY
			To who?

						NEIL
					(shrugs)
			Doesn't matter.

						NANCY
			C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.

	As they head slowly down the hill, PAN TO THE NUN IN CLOSEUP -- 
	she is fingering a rosary and whispering a prayer as she watches 
	them go.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NANCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ON NEIL at the window, staring out at the rain.  He speaks 
	quietly, almost as if to himself.

						NEIL
			I used to think I could do something
			about it...make some kind of difference
			...but they keep slipping through my 
			fingers.

	He raises a nearly empty wineglass and drains the last sip.

	WIDER ANGLE

	The remains of a Chinese takeout dinner is spread on the floor.  
	Nancy is crouched near the fireplace, feeding paper cartons to the 
	flames.

						NANCY
			Stop blaming yourself.

						NEIL
			I'm running out of answers. A patient
			sleepwalks out of a security ward up
			to a tower with no access.  A girl, 
			alone in a room, dies by jumping six
			feet straight up into a television set.
			Nothing makes sense anymore.

						NANCY
			Then maybe you're ready.

						NEIL
			For what?

						NANCY
			The truth.

						NEIL
			Try me.

						NANCY
					(considers it)
			Only if you're willing to put aside 
			everything you've learned and trust me.
			Can you do that?

						NEIL
					(pause)
			I can do that.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY

	nancy closes the door and faces the remaining kids:  Kristen, 
	Kincaid, Will, Taryn, and Joey.  Neil sits by with a clipboard on 
	his knee.  Dr. Simms is conspicuously absent.

						NEIL
			Okay.  Straigh talk only in here.

						TARYN
			Is this Group?

						NEIL
			Well, unofficially.

						WILL
			Pretty soon there won't be enough of us
			left to call it "Group."

						NEIL
			Listen up.  Nancy's got something to say.

						NANCY
					(pause)
			I know who's trying to kill you.

						KINCAID
			Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in 
			the mood.

						NANCY
			He wears a dirty brown hat.
					(this gets their attention)
			He's horribly burned.
					(all eyes on her)
			He has razors on his right hand.

						TARYN
			Who is he?

						NANCY
			Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer
			before he died.  After he died, he became
			...something worse.
					(beat)
			Six years ago Freddy killed my friends.
			He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid
			of him -- but I guess he was too strong.

	Thick silence.  The kids stare at her, flabbergasted, not knowing 
	whether to believe or doubt.  Then:

						WILL
			Why is he after us?

						TARYN
			Yeah?  What did we ever do?

						NANCY
			Not what you did.  Your parents.  My 
			parents.  They burned him alive.
			We're paying for their sins.
					(softly)
			You're the last of the Elm Street
			children.

	FAVORING THE KIDS

	as they react with bewilderment.

						WILL
					(can't grasp it)
			Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They	
			never said...

						TARYN
			Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing
			parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight
			honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers.
			Oh, by the way, your father and I torched
			some maniac last night."

						KINCAID
			So what do we do about this creep?

						NANCY
			Last time, it was me against him.  I
			wasn't strong enough...alone.

						WILL
					(catching the thread)
			But together...

						NANCY
			Kristen's the key.  She's got a very
			special talent.  A gift.

						KRISTEN
			I haven't been able to do that since
			I was a little girl.

						NANCY
			You did it the other night.

						KRISTEN
			That was different.

						NANCY
			You never lose a gift like that.  You
			just forget how to use it.
					(beat)
			How about it?  Will you try?

	Kristen nods.

						NANCY (cont.)
			Each one of you has an inner strength --
			some special power you've had in your
			most wonderful dreams.  Together we 
			can learn to use those powers...if we
			try.

						NEIL
					(muttering to Nancy)
			You sound like Peter Pan.

						NANCY
			Remember -- open mind.

						NEIL
					(dimming the lights)
			Okay, we're going to try a little group
			hypnosis.

	He turns to a high-tech chrome pendulum device sitting on the 
	tabletop and flicks a switch.  The pendulum rocks slowly from side 
	to side as a tiny blip of high intensity light flashes 
	intermittently.  Everybody stares at the device.

						NEIL (cont.)
			I want you all to follow the pendulum
			with your eyes.  Tune out everything 
			else...nothing else exists but the 
			pendulum.

						NANCY
					(softly)
			Take us there, Kristen.

						NEIL
			Breathe deeply and relax...starting with
			your toes, relax everything until there's 
			no tension left in your bodies.  None at
			all.  Keep following the pendulum...

	PANNING THE KIDS

	as they stare at the device, becoming mesmerized.

						NEIL (cont. O.S.)
			You find yourselves getting tired. 
			Nothing wuld feel better right now than
			a nice, long, deep sleep.

	ENDFRAME on Kristen.  Eyes fluttering closed.

						NEIL (cont. O.S.)
			I'm going to count backwards from five,
			and when I finish, you will all be 
			asleep.

	NANCY

	watching the pendulum, lulled under its spell.

						NEIL (cont. O.S.)
			Five...four...three...

	NEIL

	staring at the device, counting down.

						NEIL (cont.)
			...two...one.

	KRISTEN

	Her eyes snap open, she looks up.

	WIDER

	Everyone looks up.  The room is stil teh same, nothing has 
	changed.  neil switches the device off.

						KRISTEN
			I'm sorry.

	Everybody reacts, disappointed.

						NANCY
			We can try again.

						NEIL
			Everybody take five.

	Several kids stand up to stretch their legs.  Neil turns to Nancy, 
	drawing her aside.

						NEIL
			Look, I was willing to go along with this
			for the kids' peace of mind...and yours. 
			But you've got to face reality...

	JOEY

	He is at the water cooler getting a drink.  He pauses, hearing the 
	RYTHMIC SQUEAKING OF A CART.

	HIS POV

	Marcie, the cute candy-striper, appears just outside the door with 
	her cart.  She sees him and stops.

	JOEY

	gives her a goofy grin, totally in love.

	MARCIE

	looks arund to see if anybody is watching -- then smiles and 
	gestures to him.

	JOEY

	He glances around, then slips out the door unnoticed.

	INT. HALLWAY

	Marcie checks again to make sure nobody is watching, then motions 
	for Joey to follow her.

	JOEY

	hurries after her, his knees going weak.

	INT - GROUP THERAPY ROOM

	The kids are still taking a break.  neil is absently-mindedly 
	toying with the metal click-clack balls.

						NANCY
			Neil, let's try one more time.  If
			it doesn't work, then I promise --

	neil raises the end ball and sends it into the others -- instead 
	of click-clacking, they simply float apart into mid-air.

	nancy gapes as the metal balls float past her head.

	All activity comes to a standstill.  Everybody stares.

						WILL
					(realizing)
			We're here.

						TARYN
			Where...here?

						KRISTEN
			Yes.  We're in the dream.

	NEIL

	Staring at the balls, rapt and fascinated.

						NEIL
			Don't be silly...we're in Group...

						WILL (O.S.)
			In my dreams, I can walk.  My legs are
			strong.

	THE GROUP

	They all turn to see Will standing straight and tall.  No sign of 
	his wheelchair.

						WILL (cont.)
			In my dreams, I'm the Dungeonmaster.

	He plucks a metal ball from teh air, holds it in his fist, and 	
	blows in one end -- a fantasy dragonfly appears out the other.

	NANCY AND NEIL

						NANCY
			We made it.  Neil, we made it!

						NEIL
					(ducking the dragonfly)
			This isn't possible.
					(beat)
			And even if it is...what the hell am
			I doing here?
					(to Kristen)
			Did you drag me in here too?

	Kristen grins sheepishly.

						NANCY
			Try soemthing, Kristen.  What can you
			do in your dreams?

	Kristen take s afew steps back, then launches herself into a 
	perfectly executed series of twisting handflips across the room.

						WILL
			A perfct score!  The crowd goes wild!

	Kincaid picks up a metal chair and twists it open like a paperclip 
	with his bare hands.

						KINCAID
			Fuckin' A.  Dig this.

						NEIL
			Kincaid, please.  That's very unnerving.

						KINCAID
			Hey, check out Taryn.

	TARYN

	She's become a brethtaking street punk, like something out of a 
	rock fantasy:  shimmering platinum hair swept back in a wild 
	Mohawk, and sleep black leathers with delicate silver chains.

						TARYN
			In my dreams, I'm beautiful --

	She flicks out a wicked gravity knife and twirls it open faster 
	than the eye can follow.

						TARYN (cont.)
			-- and bad.

	NANCY AND NEIL

	Neil looking around, still trying to grasp it.

						NANCY
			Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream.
			Anything is possible.

						NEIL
			Anything?

	Nancy nods.

	CLOSEUP - NEIL

	He closes his eys and concentrates, trying an experiment.  He 
	opens his eyes and sees:

	NANCY

	Now wearing a frilly negligee.

						NANCY
			Very funny.

	The kids laugh and hoot.  neil blushes, very flustered.

						KINCAID
			Nice dreaming, Doc.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. DORM ROOM

	It is an unoccupied dorm room.  Marcie leads Joey in.  She closes 
	the door softly, then turns to him.

						MARCIE
			Listen, Joey...I just wanted to get you
			alone for a second.  i mean...
					(beat)
			Look, I really like you.

	She steps closer.  Joey gulps.

						MARCIE (cont.)
			Do you like me?
					(Joey nods)
			This may sound crazy, but...I make up
			excuses to come into the ward every
			day just to see you.  you're so cute.

	Joey's eyes widen.  She sits him on the bed and stands in front of 
	him.

						MARCIE (cont.)
			I could get into a lot of trouble for
			this, but I know you won't say anything.
			Will you?

	Joey shakes his head violently.  She turns her back to him.

						MARCIE (cont.)
			Unzip me.

	Joey reaches up and unzips her with shaking hands.

	She turns back and shrugs off ehr uniform.  She is wearing only 
	skimpy panties.  She is magnificent.

						MARCIE
					(coy smile)
			Do you like my body, Joey?

	Joey is overwhelmed.

	Marcie pushes Joey gently back on the bed and crawls on top of him 
	with sinewy grace.  SHe starts unbuttoning his shirt and kissing 
	his chest.

	CLOSER

	Marcie kisses his mouth, her tongue probing deeply.

	Too deeply.  Joey gags and draws back -- but Marcie's tongue grows 
	supernaturally long and burrows deeper into his mouth.

	CLOSEUP - JOEY

	Choking.  he grabs the writhing tongue and tries to pull it out of 
	his mouth.

	CLOSEUP - MARCI

	The tail end of her tongue leaps out of her mouth with a life of 
	its own.

	ON JOEY

	Both ens of the tongue/creature whip around his wrist and yank it 
	back, twining around the bedpost like a bullwhip.

	MARCIE

	A second hideously long tongue shoots out of her mouth, throught 
	the air --

	JOEY

	-- and lashes his other arm to the other bedpost with a THWACK!  
	Freddy's maniacal LAUGHTER rings out.  joey looks up.

	JOEY'S POV

	Marcie's head has been replaced by Freddy's -- his grotesque 
	laughing face perched atop her lovely body.

						FREDDY/MARCIE
					(gleefully)
			What's wrong, Joey?  I thought you liked
			my body!

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

	Two more tongues fly from his mouth simultaneously.

	JOEY'S FEET

	are lashed to the footboard bedposts.

	HIGH ANGLE

	Looking directly down on Joey writhing on the bed.  The mattress 
	drops away beneath him, descending a shaft exactly it's size.  The 
	mattress is engulfed in a fiery inferno below.  CRANE UP as Joey 
	is left suspended over a hellish pit of flame, trying desperately 
	to scream.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. GROUP THERAPY

	The lights suddenly dim and flicker out.  Everybody comes to a 
	standstill, looking around apprehensively.

			He's close...

						NANCY
			Freddy?

						KRISTEN
			He's heavy in the halls...

						TARYN
					(realizing)
			Where's Joey?

	They glance around -- Joey's not with them.

						KRISTEN
			Freddy's got him!  We've got to help him!

	Neil grabs the door to throw it open -- but yanks his hand back as 
	the knob glows red hot.  The door begins to scorch and sizzle as 
	the room turns stifling hot.

						WILL
			The room's changing!

	The walls begin to close in -- the group is backed into the center 
	of the room as it becomes rounded, cylindrical...like the inside 
	of a furnace.  Rivets appear as the walls become scorched steel 
	plate.  Neil staggers back.

						NEIL
			This is crazy...crazy...

	He looks down --

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	-- his feet are slogging through smouldering ash.  He steps on a 
	child's charred ribcage -- it crumbles and snaps underfoot like a 
	brittle leaf.  A tiny skull is churned up.

	KINCAID

	hunkers down and tries to push through the steel door, but jumps 
	back as his hands are burned.

	THE GROUP

	looks about helplessly as the smoke gets denser.  ROARING flames 
	leap up around them.  Suddnely --

	THE FURNACE DOOR

	slams open to reveal Simms standing in a perfectly normal hospital 
	hallway.  Total silence.

						SIMMS
			What's going on in here?

	REVERSE ANGLE

	The Group Therapy Room.  Neil, Nancy, and the others are seated in 
	their chairs, heads coming up as the awaken.  They gaze around, 
	still confused.

						SIMMS (cont.)
			What's wrong with Joey?

	Joey is lying unconscious on the floor near his chair, arms and 
	legs spread-eagle (in the same pose as being lashed to the bed).  
	Simms rushes over and checks him.

						SIMMS (cont.)
			He's not breathing!

	Neil pushes her out of the way and kneels over Joey, desperately 
	giving him mouth-to-mouth.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. INTENSIVE CARE - NIGHT

	TIGHT ON JOEY lying in a coma, hooked up to monitoring devices and 
	a respirator.  ANGLE WIDENS SLOWLY as we DOLLY BACK, revealing a 
	team of TECHNICIANS and NUEROSURGEONS surrounding the bed.

	CONTINUE DOLLYING BACK until we find ourselves IN THE HALLWAY 
	outside the room.  neil and Nancy hover by the door, sick with 
	worry.  DOCTOR CARVER (60's), the supervising physician of Westin 
	Hills, is stewing in controlled anger.  Dr. Simms is self-
	righteous now that her predicted disaster has taken place.

	The nuerosurgeons exit the room.					
	NUEROSURGEON
					(shakes his head)
			He's in a deep coma.  There's nothing
			we can do for him.

	The nurosurgeons walk away.  Carver turn to Neil.

						CARVER
			This is insexcusable.

						SIMMS
			The session was unauthorized.  It was
			purposely conducted without my knowledge.

						NEIL
			Unusual steps were called for.

						CARVER
			Is that what I should tell this young 
			man's parents?
					(beat)
			I understand you prescribed a highly 
			experimental drug.

						NANCY
			Dr. Carver, he's not in a coma because
			of the Hypnocyl.

						CARVER
			Young lady, your opinion is of no 
			interest to me.  Furthermore, 
			according to Dr. Simms, you've been
			creating panic among the patients.

						NEIL
			That's not true.

			Dr. Goldman, in the last four days we've
			had two suicides.  Now a boy is in a 
			coma.  I think it's fair to say your
			approach has failed...entirely.
					(beat)
			You're both relieved of your duties.
			I want you out of here.  Today.

						NANCY
			Dr. Carver --

	Neil motions her quiet.  Carver exits.

						SIMMS
			I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on
			yourself.

						NEIL
					(softly)
			For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try
			to help the kids, will you?  Listen
			to them.

						SIMMS
					(softening)
			Of course.

	She exits.  Only Nancy and Neil remain.

						NANCY
			What are we going to do?

						NEIL
					(softly)
			There's nothing we can do.  It's out of
			our hands.

	He walks away.  She watches his go, then look in Joey.  She is 
	desolate.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Neil has packed several boxes of personal files into the trunk of 
	his BMW.  He places the final box in -- it's stuffed with drawings 
	from the kids...and some photographs.

	INSERT - THE PHOTOGRAPH ON TOP

	A picture of a group picnic -- featuring Neil with Jennifer and 
	Phillip.

	CLOSEUP - NEIL

	stares sadly at the picture for an extended beat.

	LOW ANGLE

	As Neil slams the trunk, the unused wing of the hospital is 
	revealed in the background.  It is old, untended, crumbling.  A 
	shrouded white figure is standing in one of the upper floor 
	windows.

	NEIL

	sees the figure and reacts, startled.

	THE FIGURE IN THE WINDOW

	is the nun from the funeral.  She has been staring out the window 
	at him.  She turns away and disappears from view.

	NEIL

	pauses for a moment, then approaches the building.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Neil comes to a set of double doors and rattles them -- they're 
	sealed with a rusty chain and padlock.

	He moves to a broken window and peers through the boards nailed 
	across it.

	NEIL'S POV

	He can see into the long main hallway of the ground floor.  He 
	gets a brief glimpse of the nun at the far end as she comes down 
	the stairs, turns on the landing, and heads downstairs to the 
	basement.

	NEIL

						NEIL
					(knocking on the board)
			Sister?  Sister!

	She hasn't heard him.  He pries the loose board away and enters 
	through the window.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. OLD WING - BASEMENT LEVEL - NIGHT

	A forgotten, dusty corridor with peeled paint like parchment on 
	the water-stained walls.  Neil comes down the stairs, peering 
	around in the gloom.

	The only feature in the dead end hallway is a partially open rusty 
	iron door with a small barred window.  A FAINT BUZZING rises and 
	falls from within.

						NEIL
			Excuse me.  Sister?

	No answer.  Just another swell of FAINT BUZZING.  Neil approaches 
	the door and pushes it open all the way.  It SQUEALS LOUDLY on its 
	hinges.

	INT. ROOM

	Neil enters a huge, shadowy, dungeon-like room.  Flaking cement 
	pillars stand draped with cobwebs.  Rusted remains of bedframes 
	and scraps of wood litter the floor.  The BUZZING grows louder, 
	then falls away again.

						NEIL (cont.)
			Hello?

	A wooden match ignites near him, going off like a gunshot in the 
	stillness -- the nun is reavealed.  Neil gasps, startled.

						NUN
			This is where it began.

	She turns and lights a candle in a tiny alcove before a statue of 
	the Virgin Mary.  Dim light sputters up.

						NEIL
			This wing's been closed for years.
					(looking around)
			What was this place?

						NUN
			Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of
			men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst
			of the criminally insane, were locked
			away in here like animals.

						NEIL
			The whole facility was shut down in the
			Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of 
			scandal...

						NUN
					(she nods)
			A young girl on the staff was accidentally
			locked in here over the holidays.  The 
			inmates managed to keep her hidden for
			days.  She was raped...hundreds of times.
			When they found her, she was barely 
			alive...and with child.

						NEIL
					(softly)
			My God.

						NUN
			That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her 
			child --

						NEIL
			Freddy.

						NUN
			The bastard son of a hundred maniacs.
			Some say he was murdered, though no 
			body was ever found.

	Neil is momentarily distracted by another swell of BUZZING.  A fly 
	brushes past his face in the darkness.

						NEIL
			You said something before...about 
			laying him to rest...?

						NUN
			You must find the remains...and bury
			them in hallowed ground.

	The nun turns and climbs the stairs.

						NEIL
					(blankly)
			Hallowed ground?

	he moves to follow her, but his foot comes in contact with 
	something near the bottom of the steps.  The BUZZING SWELLS UP 
	LOUDLY.  He jumps back.

	NEIL'S POV

	The grisly carcass of a cat stares up at Neil, hundreds of flies 
	swarming in its dessicated flesh.

	THE NUN

	Pausing at the top of the stairs.

						NUN
			If your only faith is science, Doctor...
			it may be you that's laid to rest.

	As she exits, the door begins to CREAK slowly shut behind her, 
	plunging the room into darkness.

	NEIL

	scrambles up the steps and grabs the door just before it closes 
	shut.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Neil heaves a sigh of relief as he exits the Pit.  He looks 
	around.  The nun has disappeared.

	ON JOEY

	Short slashes suddenly begin to criss-cross his smooth chest.

	NANCY

	reacts in horror.  Neil enters B.G.

						NANCY
			Neil...

	He comes to her side and looks down.

	The slashes spell out a message in crude, bloody letters:  "COME

			You're not going in.  That's exactly what

			it's the only way he can get to you.

						NANCY
			Don't you think I know that?  I don't 
			have any choice.

						NEIL
			Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't
			do the kids any good.  Besides, we do
			have a choice.

						NANCY
			Assuming your mysterious nun in right.

						NEIL
			I've heard crazier things this week.

						NANCY
			All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit
			she seems to know more about Krueger
			than I do.

						NEIL
			The question is, what happened to Freddy's
			body?

						NANCY
			They burned him to death in his boiler
			room, but they were smart enough to 
			hide the remains.

			Who would know where they were hidden?

	TIGHT ON Kristen's face as she lets out a WAIL of total anguish

			NOOOOOOOO!

	WIDER

	Simms is standing by, watching the struggle.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			You can't send them away!  You can't!
			They're all we have!

						SIMMS
			They weren't helping you, Kristen.
			You're a sick girl.  You can only get
			better if you trust me now.

	Kristen is fighting like a wildcat -- momentum carries her and the 
	orderlies into the nurse's desk and sends them sprawling in a 
	shower of desktop items.

	She hurls a heavy stapler in Simms' direction before Max and 
	Lorenzo grab her again -- they manage to pin her arms, but barely.

	THE KIDS

	are peering fearfully up the hall at the spectacle.

	FAVORING SIMMS

						SIMMS
			Get her to the Quiet Room and sedate

	Kristen is dragged down the hall, fighting and kicking every inch

	EXT. LITTLE NEMO'S TAVERN - NIGHT

	"Tavern" is too nice a word -- it is a dive bar with a flickering 
	neon sign on the worst side of town.

	INT. LITTLE NEMO'S

	The sort of place you wind up when you have no place left to go.

	A dark, grubby figure sits in the deep foreground nursing a beer 
	and staring at nothing.  His unshaven face is hard and bitter, 
	haunted by old sorrows.  He wears a sodden, rumpled 
	nightwatchman's uniform.

						NANCY (O.S.)
			Hello Father.

	DONALD THOMPSON looks up slowly from his beer.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Nancy stands nearby with Neil.  Thompson smiles wanly.

						THOMPSON
			Well, if it isn't my little girl...
			come to visit her Daddy.

						NANCY
			It's been a long time.

						THOMPSON
			Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so
			lucky?  I thought you were trying to 
			forget I was alive.

						NANCY
			That's not true.  You're the one who's 
			trying to forget.

	She sits across from him.  Neil hovers at her side.

						NANCY (cont.)
			I need your help.  Krueger's back.

						THOMPSON
					(chuckles)
			Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a 
			little trouble understanding that,
			Princess.

						NANCY
			You know what he did.  He's doing it
			again.

						NEIL
			She's telling the truth.

	Thompson's eye flick up at Neil.

						THOMPSON
					(low, dangerous)
			I don't recall as we ever met, friend.
			And I don't believe this is any of 
			your goddamn business.

	Neil is taken aback for a moment -- he's about to retort, but 
	Nancy silences him with a look.  She leans in to her father.

						NANCY
			I think we can stop him this time.  
			Stop him for good.  But we need to 
			know where the bones were hidden.

						THOMPSON
					(slow, measured)
			I lost too much over this already.  I'm
			through with it.

						NANCY
			People are still dying.  After all this
			time.  Stop running away from it.
					(no response)
			Daddy, please...don't make me beg.
					(still no response)
			You owe me.

	Thompson meets his daughter's gaze, then averts his eyes.  He 
	takes a slow draw on his drink.

						THOMPSON (cont.)
			It's been nice seeing you, baby.
			Don't stay away so long next time.

	Nancy can't handle another moment -- she bolt from the table as 
	tears come.  Neil glares at Thompson and hurries after her.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Neil folllows her to the restroom alcove, where she is trying to 
	pull herself together.

						NEIL
			Nancy...

						NANCY
			I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.

	He wants to comfort her, but doesn't really have the words.  He 
	stands by, looking miserable.  His BEEPER GOES OFF.  He checks it 
	for the number and crosses to the payphone.

			Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.

						NEIL
			Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her

					(Nancy tries to argue)
			Do it.

	Nancy takes the keys.  Their eyes lock for a long, intense moment 
	-- then they share a spontaneous, passionate kiss.

	Nancy turns and leaves without another word.

	ANGLE ON THOMPSON

	He sees his daughter leave, then turns his blank gaze back to his 
	beer.

	Neil casually walks over.  Thompson ignores him.

						NEIL
			I'm Neil Goldman.  Pleased to meet you.

			There, we've met.

	Suddenly, unexpectedly, Neil lashes viciously out with his foot

	Thompson can so much as blink, neil hauls him out of his chair and 
	slams him violently against the wall.

	TIGHT TWO SHOT

			Listen up, asshole.  I don't know if

	Neil gets out of the car.  he empties the contents of the pint 
	bottle on the pavement as he hurries toward the church.

	INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Three WORSHIPPERS are seated in the pews, seeking comfort in 
	silent prayer.  Neil rushes in at the back of the church.

	CLOSER - NEIL

	sees a small basin of holy water attached to the wall.  he 
	submerges Thompson's bottle, filling it with holy water.  He caps 
	the bottle, pockets it, then proceeds up the aisle.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Neil comes to a candle shrine.  A foot-high crucifix is attached 
	to the wall above it.  He grabs the cross and tries to lift it off 
	its mount -- it comes loose with a loud CLANG, a lift it off its 
	mount -- it comes loose with a loud CLANG, a jarring sound in the 
	silent church.  Worshippers turn to look.

	Feeling comspicuous, Neil turns to find himself facing a PRIEST.

						NEIL
			Oh.  Hello.

	The Quiet room becomes a white void of ripping and slashing -- a 
	vicious blizzard of whirling padding.

	WILL

	The blades lash out from the billowing clouds of cotton.  He's 
	forced back.

	TARYN

	screams as the blades flash by her.

	NANCY

						NANCY
					(shielding her eyes)
			HOLD HANDS!  FIND EACH OTHER!

	KRISTEN

	Screaming, panicking, spun around in the blizzard.  Lost.

						KRISTEN
			NANCY!

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	The blizzard of cotton padding dissipates and slowly vanishes.  
	Kristen looks up a dream.

	ANGLE WIDENS SLOWLY OUT to reveal Kristen sitting at her drafting 
	table in her bedroom at home.  The crude paper mache Elm Street 
	House model is in front of her, still under construction.  Warren 
	Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" still blares from the radio.

	Nothing has changed.  She's still home.  Safe.  She wonders if all 
	of it, everything, has been nothing but a bad dream.

	Her mother enters, dressed in the same beautiful evening gown, and 
	snaps the radio off.

						ELAINE
			Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!

						KRISTEN
					(bleary-eyed)
			Mom?

						ELAINE
			What are you still doing up?  It's past 
			one.

						KRISTEN
			I thought I'd wait for you.

						ELAINE
					(touched)
			Well, I'm home now, so you can go right
			to sleep.  C'mon, angel.

	She turns down teh covers.  Kristen crawls onto the bed and throws 
	her arms around Elaine's neck in a spontaneous hug.

						ELAINE (cont.)
			What's that for?

						KRISTEN
			I'm just glad you're home.

	Elaine gives her a kiss and tucks her in.  She goes to teh door 
	and reaches for the lightswitch.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			Mom?

						ELAINE
					(pauses in doorway)
			What?

						KRISTEN
			I had such an awful dream.

	A MAN'S VOICE comes from downstairs:

						MAN (O.S.)
			Elaine?  Where do you keep the bourbon?

						ELAINE
			I'll be right down.
					(to Kristen)
			Kris, I've got a guest.

						KRISTEN
			Can we talk?  Just for a minute?

						ELAINE
			Can't it wait till morning?

						KRISTEN
			Please Mom?  I just don't want to be 
			alone.

	Suddenly, Elaine is violently yanked out the door, revealing:

	FREDDY

	framed in the doorway, wearing immaculate formal wear, screaming 
	at Elaine (she's off camera).

						FREDDY
			BITCH!  I SAID WHERE'S THE FUCKING 
			BOURBON!

	He sweeps his razors down at her.

	KRISTEN

	SCREMING in bed.

	FREDDY

	Grinning insanely, he leans into the room, holding Elaine's 
	decapitated head up for Kristen.

						FREDDY
			You should listen to your mother,
			Kristen.

	CLOSEUP - ELAINE'S HEAD

	Dangling in Freddy's grasp, blood dripping from the neck, it 
	jabbers at Kristen in a glassy-eyed harangue.

						ELAINE'S HEAD
			Gaddamn it Kristen, you always ruin
			everything!  Every time I have a man 
			over you spoil it!  You know what 
			your shrink said!  You're only trying
			to get attention!

	KRISTEN

	screaming and screaming.

	FREDDY

	drops the head and lunges at her, claws swiping the air.

	KRISTEN

	rolls out of bed as Freddy's claws tear her pillow open in an 
	explosion of feathers.

	WIDER

	Kristen turns and runs, Freddy right on her heels,  his finger 
	blades mere inches from her back.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kristen's momentum takes her right up the wall -- she pushes off 
	in an incredible gymnast's flip, hurtling up in an arc back over 
	Freddy's head -- Freddy hits the wall, his finger-razors burying 
	deep in the plaster.

	KRISTEN

	makes a perfect landing near her bed and snatches up her 
	bedspread.

	FREDDY

	howls with rags and yanks his razors from the wall in an explosion 
	of plaster.  he whirls and dives at Kristen --

	-- as she flings the bedspread over him.  He tangles up, going 
	down hard, thrashing to get free.

	KRISTEN 

	hurtles herself out the window in an explosion of glass.

	FREDDY

	Ripping and slashing,  he wrestles the bedspread off and hurls it 
	away in tatters.  He looks aroudn, howling with rage.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kristen EXPLODES through a skylight in the living room ceiling and 
	drops to teh floor in a rain of glass.  Bruised and battered, she 
	rises to her feet and looks around.  Lost.  Alone.

						KRISTEN
					(calling out)
			Nancy!

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Whirling cotton fills the screen...dissipating to reveal Taryn in 
	her full dream warrior splendor, platinum crest of hair 
	shimmering.  She finds herself in a twisting hallway in teh 
	dreamscape -- and hears KRISTEN'S FAINT CALL.

						TARYN
					(calling out)
			Kristen?  Is that you?

	She hurries up a passageway and turns a corner.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Freddy leaps from the darkness, blades flashing.

	Taryn nimbly dodges and whirls, producing two large gravity 
	knives.  She click-clacks them open, twirling them expertly.

						TARYN
			Okay asshole.  Let's dance.

	Freddy gives her an evil smile and squares off against her.

	They circle each otehr slowly...then Freddy lashes out.

	Taryn ducks and cuts deeply across Freddy's ribs.

	Freddy SCREAMS with anger and swipes twice more, ripping deep 
	gouges in Taryn's shoulder.

	Taryn draws back, keeping her guard up.  She feints, then strikes 
	out, slashing Freddy again.

	This time Freddy draws back.

						FREDDY
			Taryn...why should we fight?  You and
			I are old friends.

	Taryn stands poised, ready for anything.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

						FREDDY
					(grinning)
			Let's get high.

	He raises his hands into frame -- his fingerhave all turned into 
	oversized hypodermic neeles, their needle-sharp tips glittering in 
	the darkness.

	TARYN

	Revolted by teh weird display.  She looks down, feeling something 
	strange.

	CLOSEUP - TARYN'S ARMS

	Her needle track scars are expanding and contracting like tiny 
	sucking mouths...hungry...

	WIDER

	The instant her guard is down, Freddy lunges at her and buries 
	both sets of hypodermic fingers into her arms, pinning her to the 
	wall.  Taryn SCREAMS.

	CLOSEUP - HYPO FINGERS

	As their inner plunges depress, Taryn's biceps swell grotesquely, 
	veins bulging impossibly.

	TARYN

	We can actually see the high-pressure fluid travel upward as her 
	veins and body balloon, racing from her arms -- her neck swells -- 
	temples expand -- eyeballs bulge --

	Then the top of her head literally exploded.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

						FREDDY
			What a rush.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET BASEMENT - NIGHT

	MOVING WITH Will -- he holds a torch high in one hand, a saber in 
	the other.  He looks like a thin pirate out of a Dungeons and 
	Dragons game.

						WILL
					(calling out)
			Hello?  You guys, where are you?

	He heas a SOUND somewhere in the darkness ahead.  He 
	pauses...nothing.  Suddenly, there's a SOUND OF SCREECHING METAL 
	and a strange object comes racing out of the darkness at him.  He 
	lunges out of the way.

	THE OBJECT

	screeches to a halt and wheels about.  It's an oversiezed, 
	nightmarish version of Will's wheelchair -- made of rusty, twisted 
	metal and bristling with spikes and hooks.  To sit in it would be 
	agonizing death.

						FREDDY (O.S.)
			You look tired, Will.  Have a seat.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Will whirls about to see Freddy leaning nonchalantly against a 
	pillar.

						WILL
					(shaken)
			No thanks.  I'm fine just the way I am.

						FREDDY
			For now.  But when you wake up...
					(singing)
			...you're back in the saddle again.

	Will is visibly upset by this -- and reacts too slowly as the 
	wheelchair bears down on him again.

	WILL

	is sideswiped and knocked to the ground, his leg bleeding.

	THE CHAIR

	spins around, preparing for another run.

	FREDDY

						FREDDY
			It's the chair for you, kid.

	THE CHAIR

	The wheels smoke, burning rubber as it launches itself at Will.

	CLOSEUP - WILL

						WILL
					(softly, to himself)
			I'm the Dungeonmaster...the Dungeonmaster...

	WIDER

	Will suddenly levitates to his feet.  A wizard's robe swirls about 
	him as crackling electricity plays across his fingertips, just 
	like the illustration on the Dungeonmaster game card.

	LOW ANGLE

	The wheelchair ROARS over camera.

	WILL

	Green lightning explodes from his fingertips and shatters the 
	wheelchair into fragments.

	FREDDY

	reacts in surprise.

	WILL

	looks up at Freddy, grinning with his newfound power.  The dancing 
	lights emanating from his fingers cast a weird glow across his 
	face.

						WILL
			In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves --
			demon begone!

	WIDER

	Will rushes at Freddy, shooting wizard's fire.  The crackling 
	green energy engulfs Freddy completely --

	-- but Freddy grabs Will by the front of his shirt and lifts him 
	off the ground.

	CLOSER

	Freddy snarls into Will's face as the living energy twines around 
	him.

						FREDDY
			Sorry kid.  I don't believe in fairy 
			tales.

	Freddy buries his claws in Will's chest -- the blades points jut 
	out of Will's back as his death cry ECHOES down teh halls.

									           CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kristen wanders through the twisting distorted hallways of the 
	dreamscape.  She hears Will's SCREAM echo and fade away.

						KRISTEN
			HELLO?  ANYBODY?

						NANCY'S VOICE
					(faint, faraway)
			Kristen?

	She turns a corner and sees Nancy at the end of a hallway.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			Nancy!

	They rush toward each other -- but stop as they hear a strange 
	CRUNCHING SOUND.

						KRISTEN
			What's that?

						NANCY
			I don't know.

	The SOUND comes again -- a horrible CRACKING AND SNAPPING.  The 
	wall begins to spiderweb with cracks as it bulges outward.  
	Something big seems to be trying to press through to cut them off 
	from each other.  Nancy and Kristen back away warily.

	Suddenly, there is an EXPLOSION of wood and plaster -- and Kincaid 
	steps through.

						KINCAID
					(grinning)
			Yo.  I thought I heard voices.

	Nancy and Kristen yell with delight.  Kristen throws her arms 
	around him.

						KRISTEN
			Kincaid!  I could kiss you!

						KINCAID
			What's stopping you?

	Kristen is taken aback for a moment -- then gives him a chaste but 
	sincere kiss on the mouth.  He grins.

						KINCAID
			Cool.  So where's Joey?

						KRISTEN
			I don't know.  It's like a maze in here.

						KINCAID
			Then it's time to stop guessin' and
			start messin'.
					(hollering)
			FREDDY!  WHERE YOU HIDING, YOU PUSSY?

						NANCY
			Kincaid -- we should find the others
			first...

						KINCAID
			YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID --
			LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!
					(silence)
			KRUEGER!

	Still no response.

						KINCAID (cont.)
					(muttering)
			I knew he was chickensh--

	Suddenly, the lights around them flinker and dim.  They hear a 
	DEEP, REVERBERATING GROAN OF METAL.  All look over the railing.

	OVER THE SHOULDER

	as they peer downward.  Where before there was nothing, there are 
	now two huge, rusty boiler room doors slowly swinging open like 
	the entrance to Hell.  Orange light flickers from below.

	KINCAID

	Still finishing his prior statement.

						KINCAID
			-- shhhiiiiit.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The tree slowly descend teh stairs, all bravado lost.  They stop 
	before the immense gate.  Within lies flickering darkness and 
	twisting steps leading down.

						NANCY
			This is it.  Are you ready?

	Kristen nods.

						KINCAID
			Let's snuff the fucker.

	They descend.

	INT. BOILER ROOM - ENTRANCE

	Nancy, Kristen, and Kincaid cautiously come down the winding 
	stairs and pass under an arch way made of twisted, scorched 
	tricycles and shattered dolls.

	They exchange worried looks, then step through.

	MASTER

	A surrealistic boiler room, air red with heat and haze.

	Freddy sits on a throne made of children's skulls and bones.

	Joey is nearby, suspended over the pit of flames like a weird 
	altar.

	Welcome to Freddy Hell.

	FREDDY

						FREDDY
					(low gutteral chuckle)
			Look Joey...all the little piggies have
			come home.

	JOEY

	He turns his terrified, pleading eyes toward his friends.  His 
	skin is hot and blistered.  The tongues that lash his hands and 
	feet to the four posts are writhing slowly, licking his ankles and 
	wrists.  He opens his mouth in a mute, silent scream.

	NANCY, KRISTEN, KINCAID

						KRISTEN
					(softly)
			Joey...

	Nancy steps forward.

						NANCY
			Let him go.

	THE THRONE

	Freddy sweeps his hands, the obedient servant.

						FREDDY
			Your wish is my command.

	He makes a gesture.

	JOEY

	The tongue/creature securing his left wrist unravels -- he drops 
	precariously.  The other tongues begin to loosen their hold.

	NANCY

	lunges to the edge of the pit, reaching for Joey.

	FREDDY

	laughs maniacally.

	THE PIT

	The last tongues give way and Joey drops --

	-- just as Nancy snatches his wrist and hangs on.  Kincaid grabs 
	Nancy by the belt and hauls them both back out.

	KRISTEN

	With a cry, she runs and does a double flip over the burning 
	pit -- right at Freddy.

	THE THRONE

	Kristen snap-kicks right into Freddy's face, toppling him and the 
	throne backwards.

	KINCAID

	strains as he rips a six-foot section of pipe from the wall and 
	races toward the throne.

	NANCY

	helps Joey to his feet just as a tongue/creature flies out of the 
	darkness and whips around her neck, strangling her.

	FREDDY

	rises from the rubble of his throne and lashes at Kristen.  She 
	flips over his head -- but Freddy backhands her, sending her 
	spinning across the room.

	NANCY

	Clutching one end of the writhing tongue, she forces it to the 
	ground.  She grabs a furnace poker and skewers the creature.  It 
	instantly unravels from her neck.

	THE FALLEN THRONE

	As Freddy prepares to slash Kristen, Kincaid races in, swinging 
	his pipe in a wide arc.  It smashes across Freddy's back, driving 
	him to his knees.

	Kincaid raises the pipe for a second blow, but Freddy leaps up 
	with a ROAR and grabs Kincaid, hauling him high over his head.

	Nancy rushes in just as Freddy's arms are extended and plunges the 
	poker into his heart.

	Everyone freezes.

	FREDDY

	looks down at the poker with an exaggerated gasp -- then flashes a 
	grin at Nancy.

	NANCY

	reacts in horror.

	FREDDY

	releases Kincaid's feet and holds him dangling by the throat.

	With his free hand, he pulls the poker slowly from his chest.  He 
	looks at the tip -- it glistens with dark, rancid gore.  He licks 
	it like an ice cream cone.

	NANCY AND KRISTEN

	Kristen rises, using Nancy for support.

						KRISTEN
			Nancy!

						NANCY
			He's too strong!  He was never this
			strong!

	FREDDY

	whirls to her, Kincaid still choking in his upraised fist.

						FREDDY
					(hissing)
			Yesss!  The souls of the children...

	He rips his shirt open, revealing his hideously scarred body.

						FREDDY (cont.)
			...they make me stronger.

	His flesh begins to undulate and swell.

	TIGHT ON FREDDY'S TORSO

	Rippling blisters appear, forming into faces -- horrible, tortured 
	faces wailing in despair.  We recognize Phillip ... Jennifer ... 
	Will ... Taryn ...

	NANCY AND KRISTEN

	Total horror and revulsion.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

	An insane, gleeful grin -- and a gutteral whisper:

						FREDDY
			Always room for more.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - TRUNK OF '59 CADILLAC - NIGHT

	The burlap sack is lifted out.

	TIGHT ON BURLAP SACK

	as neil drops it beside a freshly dug grave.  Freddy's bones 
	clatter.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

	Freddy flinches in pain -- he looks up in fear, suddenly aware 
	that somebody's disturved his bones.  His fear is slowly replaced 
	by an evil, cunning grin.

	He vanishes -- Kincaid finds himself struggling and choking in 
	mid-air.  He drops to the ground, gasping for breath.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	Thompson crawls from the shallow grave and throws the shovel 
	aside.

						THOMPSON
			What the hell good is this supposed to
			do?

	Ignoring him, Neil picks up the tire iron and holds it up.

						NEIL
			This will be our headstone.

	He jams the tire iron into the ground at the foot of the grave.  
	It looks like a cross.

						THOMPSON
					(hears something)
			What was that?

						NEIL
			What?

						THOMPSON
			Listen.

	Neil now hears the FAINT SOUND OF ROCK MUSIC on the night breeze.

						NEIL
			Somebody else is out here.

						THOMPSON
			No.  We're alone.

	Another song snaps to life -- closer to them.  The Rolling Stones'  
	"Sympathy for the Devil."

	INT. WRECKED CHEVY

	We can see Neil and Thompson through the cracked windshield of the 
	rusted-out Chevy.  The radio suddenly lights up, blaring another 
	rock song.

	NEIL AND THOMPSON

	More MUSIC comes from all around them, blasting from teh radios of 
	long-dead autos, a cacophony of rock songs from the 50's and 60's.  
	We hear the HOWLING of Wolfman Jack.

	THE CARS - VARIOUS ANGLES

	Broken headlights sputter to life.  A windshield wiper near 
	Thompson slaps madly back and forth across shattered glass.  Horns 
	honk.  An exposed fan blade WHIRRS like a buzzsaw.

	NEIL AND THOMPSON

						THOMPSON
					(hoarse whisper)
			The whole place is coming to life...

	Both men turn to look at the burlap sack.  There is a slight 
	stirring from within.

	Neil hurries over and grabs the sack to throw it into the grave.

	THE SACK

	Suddenly, a skeletal hand wearing finger-razors tears through the 
	rotted burlap and latches onto Neil's wrist.

	The sack rips wide open as Freddy's charred bones leap into 
	life -- a hideous shambling skeleton SCREAMING with unearthly 
	rage.

	THOMPSON

	Frozen  to the spot.  Can't believe his eyes.

	NEIL

	falls back, scrambling away as Freddy's blades slash the air 
	inches in front of his face.

	WIDER

	Suddenly, Jesse the junkyard dog hurtles out of the darkness onto 
	the hellish thing's back, biting and snapping.

	The skeleton pulls the dog from its back, slashes its throat in 
	one quick motion, and tosses the carcass aside.

	THOMPSON

	Something snaps in him as he glares at the skeleton.

						THOMPSON
			It's really you.

	CLOSEUP - SKELETON

	It turns and grins hideously at Thompson.

	THOMPSON

	grabs a piece of pipe and rushes the monster.

						THOMPSON
			I'll send you back to Hell here you
			belong!

	THE CREATURE 

	meets Thompson's rush head on, blocking the pipe and yanking him 
	off his feet.

	It hurls Thompson through the air with incredible force.

	THE CADILLAC

	Thompson slams into it, impaled on the tail fin.  He looks down at 
	the metal point jutting from his chest...and dies.

	NEIL

	grabs the shovel and swings it -- the skeleton ducks and slashes 
	Neil's ribs, ripping his shirt wide open.

	As Neil doubles over, the skeleton rips the shovel from his hands 
	and smashes it solidly against his head.  Before Neil can crumple, 
	the creature straightens him up with a second vicious blow -- we 
	hear BONE CRACK.  Neil falls back into the grave.

	The skeleton shrieks with unholy laughter and begins to shovel the 
	loose dirt onto Neil.

	It tosses the shovel aside, raises its arms into the air with a 
	victorious HOWL -- and collapses into a pile of bones.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

	Nancy, Kristen, Kincaid, and Joey exit the boiler room, limping, 
	battered, and bloody.  They face the weird perspectives of the Elm 
	Street halls.

						NANCY
			Kristen, can you pull us out?

						KRISTEN
			They sedated me.  We're stuck here till
			it wears off.

						NANCY
			Let's try this way.

	They start down a corridor and enter:

	INT. SEWING ROOM

	Eerie mannikins and an ornate three-way mirror stand in teh 
	shadows.

						KRISTEN
			It's a dead end.

	Suddenly, there's activity in the mirror.  A wavering light...then 
	Freddy materializes.  An infinity of Freddies are reflected in the 
	three-way mirror behind him.

						FREDDY
			Sorry to keep you waiting.  Perhaps if
			there were more of me to spread around.

	Freddy runs into the room, magically followed by rows of his 
	mirror reflections.

						KINCAID
			Holy shit!  He's multiplying!

	The room is suddenly filled with dozens of Freddies slashing and 
	chasing our heroes.

	NANCY

	leaps over a wicker basket to escape a Freddy.  As a second Freddy 
	lunges, she jams a knitting needle through its throat.

	KRISTEN

	springs over a group of Freddies, catches a wall fixture, and 
	flips across the room.

	KINCAID

	With a battle cry, he plows into the charging Freddies, bowling 
	them over.

	JOEY

	cringes back, cowering behind the mannikins.

	THE MIRROR

	More Freddies pouring into the room.

	NANCY

	is backed into a corner, torn with slash marks.

	KRISTEN

	delivering flying kicks, but slowing down.  A Freddy grabs her 
	from behind, holding her for the others.

	KINCAID

	goes down under the sheer weight of Freddies crawling all over 
	him, slashing.  There are jsut too many.

	JOEY

	steps out from behind teh mannikins, shaking with emotion as his 
	friends are overwhelmed -- none of them can last more that a few 
	seconds longer.  He opens his mouth and -- 

	CLOSEUP - JOEY

						JOEY
			NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

	An incridible, deafening, universe-shaking cry.  Joey has found 
	his dream power.

	THE THREE-WAY MIRROR

	is blown into fragments.

	VARIOUS ANGLES

	All the Freddies EXPLODING into shards of hurtling glass as nancy, 
	Kristen, and Kincaied cover their ears.

	JOEY

	finally stops.  Total silence.  He looks just as surprised as 
	everyone else at what he's done.

						JOEY
					(softly)
			Wow.
					(does a double take
					 at his own voice)
			Did I say that?

						KINCAID
			You sure as shit did!  You saved our
			asses!

						KRISTEN
			He's gone!  We got him!

	Kincaid scoops Joey into his arms in a crushing bear hug.

						JOEY
			Hey man, put me down!

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

	TIGHT ON the open grave.  A bloody, dirt-encrusted hand grasps the 
	edge of teh grave.  A second hand follows.  Neil Goldman slowly, 
	painfully pulls himself out of the grave.

	He has an ugly wound on the side of his head and his collarbone's 
	broken -- but he's alive.

	Gasping with pain, Neil crawls to the pile of Freddy's remains.  
	With tremendous effort, he pushes hte bones over the edge into the 
	grave.

	CLOSEUP - GRAVE

	The bones tumble into the earthen pit.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT

	Kristen helps Nancy to her feet as she brushes away the shattered 
	glass of the Freddies.

						KRISTEN
			Are you okay?

						NANCY
			I think so.

	They embrace tearfully.

						NANCY
					(softly)
			It's over.  It's over.

						THOMPSON (O.S.)
			Nancy...

	Nancy turns and sees her father floating toward her, glowing in a 
	golden nimbus of light.

						NANCY
			Daddy?

						THOMPSON (cont.)
			I've crossed over, Princess.

						NANCY
			Crossed over?

						THOMPSON
			But I couldn't go until I told you how
			sorry I am for all the things I've done.

	Nancy gazes at him, slowly comprehending.

						THOMPSON (cont.)
			I love you so much.  I'll always love
			you.  Goodbye, Princess.

	Nancy goes to embrace ehr father one final time.

						NANCY
			I'll always love you, Dadd --

	Her words are cut short as her body jerks violently.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHT

	"Thompson" is wearing Freddy's glove -- the razors buried in 
	Nancy's stomach.

	CLOSEUP - NANCY

	Her eyes wide and staring as she realizes.

						NANCY
					(weakly)
			No.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY/THOMPSON

	As Thompson's face disappears and is replaced by Freddy's.

						FREDDY
			Die, bitch.

	He jams the blades in deeper.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT - JUNKYARD - NIGHT

	CLOSEUP ON Neil -- using his one good hand, he grasps the bottle 
	of holy water and uncorks it with his teeth.  He presses it to his 
	forehead and closes his eyes.

						NEIL
					(hoarse whisper)
			Please God.  For the children.  For
			Nancy.

	He looks down at Freddy's remains.

						NEIL (cont.)
			Ashes to ashes.

	He flicks a stream of holy water onto the bones.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT

	Freddy, still locked in an embrace with Nancy as she dies, SCREAMS 
	as a pattern of holes rip across his body -- bright shafts of 
	light burst through.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

						NEIL
			Dust to dust.

	He flicks a second stream of water.

									           CUT TO:

	INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT

	Another arc of holes explode across Freddy's body.  He arches 
	back, SHRIEKING --

	-- and Nancy slides of his blades.  Kristen runs to her.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT - JUNKYARD - NIGHT

	Neil holds the crucifix.  He leans down and presses it against the 
	skull.

						NEIL
			Lay this spirit to rest.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. SEWING ROOM - CLOSEUP FREDDY

	A cross-shaped hole explodes from Freddy's forehead -- brilliant, 
	blinding white light pours out.

	WIDER

	As Freddy staggers back, riddled with glowing holes, we see a 
	whrilwind of spirit faces pouring from him -- sould of his victims 
	soaring out, freed at last.

	KINCAID AND JOEY

	Awestruck as they watch.

	FREDDY

	The holes expand, eating Freddy alive as his SCREAM ECHOES across 
	the dreamscape.

	The shafts of light from his body merge into one white hot ball -- 
	then EXPLODES.

	Freddy is gone.

	KRISTEN

	cradles Nancy in her arms.  nancy is drifting toward death.

						KRISTEN
					(crying)
			He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't
			die, Nancy.  Please.

						NANCY
					(weak)
			I'm so proud of you all.
					(pause)
			Tell Neil I...

	She sags against Kristen.  Kristen shakes her head, tears 
	brimming.

						KRISTEN
			I won't let you die.  i won't.
					(lower, strange intensity)
			I'm going to dream you...
					(whispering in Nancy's ear)
			I'm going to dream you into a beautiful
			dream.  Forever and ever.

	She closes her eyes and holds Nancy tight.

									 SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK

	Three caskets are surrounded by a large number of MOURNERS.

	CLOSER

	Kristen, Joey, and Kincaid watch tearfully.  Neil, wearing a neck 
	brace, puts his arm around the kids as the caskets are lowered.

	CLOSEUP - NEIL

	He notices movement on the hilltop.

	NEIL'S POV

	The nun stands on the crest of the hill.  She turns and walks 
	away, disappearing from view.

	NEIL

	leaves the funeral and starts up the hillside after her.

	HILLTOP

	As neil reaches the tree where he first met the nun, he catches a 
	glimpse of her as she dissappears behind a crypt.

						NEIL
			Sister...wait.

	THE CRYPT

	Neil rounds the crypt -- the nun has vanished.

	Only a simple tombstone stands at this edge of the field.

	Neil steps closer.

	THE TOMBSTONE

	The inscription reads:

				Here Lies Amanda Krueger

				   Her name in Christ,
				   Sister Mary Helena.

				  Born 1907 - Died 1968

	CLOSEUP - NEIL

						NEIL
					(softly)
			My God.  You were his mother.

										DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The seasons have changed.  A blanket of freshly fallen snow covers 
	the house.  A VW Rabbit with New York plates is parked in the 
	driveway.

	INT. NEIL'S HOUSE

	Kristen and Neil have finished a meal together and are sipping 
	wine.  Her hair is shorter.  Neil looks thinner, a little weary.

						NEIL
			I'm glad things have worked out for you.

						KRISTEN
			I think new York was just what I 
			needed.  So many people.  I never feel
			alone.

						NEIL
					(smiles)
			The city that never sleeps.
					(pause)
			So what will you do now?

						KRISTEN
			I don't know.  I'm busy with school.
			New friends.
					(beat)
			But I'll never forget the old ones.

						NEIL
					(raises his glass)
			To old friends.  And your new dreams.

						KRISTEN
			To old friends.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Neil is at the door, seeing Kristen off.

						NEIL
			It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad
			you dropped by.

						KRISTEN
					(pauses at her car)
			Do you still...see each other?

						NEIL
					(strange little smile)
			Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.

	Kristen nods.  She knew it.

						KRISTEN
			Will you say hi?
					(he smiles that he will)
			Good night.

	INT. HOUSE

	Neil closes the door.  He's alone in the empty house.  He turns 
	out the lights and trudges slowly upstairs.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Neil in bed, drifting off to sleep.  The tight, weary look is gone 
	from his face -- he looks peaceful, contented.

	PAN TO the paper mache model of the Elm Street House.  It's 
	different now -- clean and pure and inviting.  A lovely little 
	place, in fact.

										    FADE OUT

						THE END
